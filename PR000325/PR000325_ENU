The product configurator allows you to define which characteristics affect the price of the configured product.

To set prices it is therefore mandatory to:  
\- Specify which characteristic rules will determine the configured item price.

<br>

Insert the characteristics into the price matrix respecting the same sequence with which the characteristics are inserted in the rule. The combination of characteristics will determine the price of the item. The price matrix allows you to enter up to a maximum of 10 characteristics even in from/to mode.

In the matrix, you can manage prices for the following types of price lists:
* **Customer price group.** Used in all sales documents and from the item card.
* **Customer.** Used in all sales documents.
* **All customers.** Used in all sales documents.
* **Campaign.** Used in all sales documents.
* **Vendor.** Used in all purchase documents.
* **All vendors**. Used in all purchase documents.

The prices of the item configured by a Sales document can be retrieved from:
-   Sell-to Customer or Bill-to Customer, depending on what is set in Setup  field "Get prices for customer".

If the Product configuration is launched from the item card, the prices in the price list set as Default in the configurator Setup will be proposed.

It is possible to automatically create a price list line (Business Central standard prices) at the end of the configuration, activating the Enable Sales Price flag or the Enable purchase price flag.

<br>

Prices can be updated via the Price Matrix Worksheet (CFG). Similar to the Standard Price Worksheet, it has two fundamental functions, Suggest Price Matrix and Implement Price Change.   
The price matrix worksheet can also be used for data import via configuration packages (direct import into the price matrix table is only possible via import from excel sheets, but not through configuration packages).
