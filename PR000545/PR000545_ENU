The system, upon posting a work request generates a series of ledger entries including:

- Item Ledger Entry: a negative adjustment will be generated for each spare part used for the item associated with the spare part.
- Resource Ledger Entry: an entry is made for each activity performed by the resources indicated in the work request.

The system will also generate "Work Ledger Entries", "Machine Activity Entries" and "Work Request Cycle Entries".
