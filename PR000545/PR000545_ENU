The system, upon posting a work request posts a series of ledger entries including:

- Item Ledger Entry: a negative adjustment will be posted for each spare part (item) used.
- Resource Ledger Entry: an entry is posted for each activity performed by the resources specified in the work request.
- Job Ledger Entry: if a project is specified, related records will be posted.

The system will also post "Work Ledger Entries", "Machine Activity Entries" and "Work Request Cycle Entries".

### Work Ledger Entries

Allows you to view spare parts (items) and resourse entries posted with their unit costs and amounts.

The reference to the machine activity entry recorded simultaneously to the work ledger entry is contained in the field "Machine Activity Entry No.".
