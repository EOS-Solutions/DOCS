* All: the material status is calculated **for all firm planned and released production orders** (planned ones are not considered).

* Selected Lines: is calculated **only for the selected operations** (the related production orders).

The material status calculation has the following priorities:

* Released orders have higher priority, firm planned orders are later.

* If the warehouse is used and a pick has been made for a released order, then this order has the highest priority
