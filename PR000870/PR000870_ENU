Gordon chooses the package feeds to use based on the server you are connecting to. This means that you can have one set of package feeds for a **BC24** development environment and a different set of package feeds for a **BC25** development environment. 

Gordon VS Code does this by using your `launch.config` to determine which target you are working with. This is essential, because the various package management related actions that are available in Gordon VS Code will be based on this concept.

To choose which feeds you want to use with wich server, you can go to list of servers in Gordon and using the **Select Package Feeds** action you can select one or more feeds to be used with this target.

This will open the list of all available package feeds and you can select one or more that you want to use with this target server / service.
