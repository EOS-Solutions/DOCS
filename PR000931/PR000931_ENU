Starting from versions **23.0.41, 24.0.28, 25.0.13**, in order to retrieve data relating to CIG and CUP and bring them to the customer bill and vendor bill, the fields have been added and managed in the customer ledger entries and vendor ledger entries.
These fields are enhanced when the document (invoice\credit memo) is posted, retrieving the values from the fields in the document header.

#### CIG and CUP in customer bill
In the customer bill line and the issued customer bill line, the fields Fattura Tender Code (CIG) and Fattura Project Code (CUP) have been added, retrieved directly from customer ledger entries.

It will not be possible to accumulate effects for the same customer and the same due date with different CIG and CUP. The user will be notified with an error when creating the EFFETTI.TXT file.


#### CIG and CUP in the EFFETTI.TXT file
The CIG and CUP data are reported in Record50 together with the information on the Document No. and the date.

In the case of cumulative effects, with the same CIG and CUP and due date, the documents will be grouped.
