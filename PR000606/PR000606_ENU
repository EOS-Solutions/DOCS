It is possible to define a price sequence for different structures:

* Customer (Header)

Business Central searches for dedicated prices for the customer (in the order header)
If not found, it moves to sequence 2 and so on.
The first and last levels are not editable as they represent the first and last detail levels.

* Items (lines)

Business Central performs a control based on the data entered in the "Item" section.
