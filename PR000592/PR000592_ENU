Customer hierarchies are used to define the hierarchy of GDO groups. 
It can be applied in any context comprising multiple levels (up to 11), down to the last level, which is the customer. 

The relationship is 1 to 1 between a level and its superior.

** Customer Hierarchy Assignment **

Through the customer master data, it is possible to assign the hierarchy. 
Depending on the managed fields (number of hierarchy levels), the respective codes with captions entered in the setup will be displayed. Levels can also be added at a later stage.

Each hierarchy assignment opens the "Hierarchy Relationship Request".
