the system has found two shipping options for DHL and one for FEDEX and proposes freight costs and additional charges for each option, based on the number of packages and weight.

It also specifies the % relative to the transport cost of the total document. Finally, it proposes the total costs in the "Transport cost (Expected)" column. By selecting the line relating to the preferred option (eg FEDEX) and pressing Confirm Shipping Agent, this choice is confirmed and the shipper / service is assigned to the document.

You can filter the report by Shipping Agent if necessary.
