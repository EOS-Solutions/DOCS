### Table Groups and Table Shortcut

To define the tables groups which will be reported on advanced text click, for example, on the drlldown botton in the Group 1 field.

The system will open the Table Groups page:

From the field table shortcut, you can open the page to choose:

In this list the tables are encoded with a code based on their logic function. This list is already present in the system by default.

When creating a sales order and verifying from Navigate->Extended Text we will find only Text 1 and Text 2 (Text 3 will be written only on purchase orders):

From New it is always possible to add advanced texts, which in this case will be referred to the order that we are creating and will be inherited by the posted invoice.

Now we add a "Text 4":

and we post Invoice and Shipment:

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000684-0/ADR_Post_ENU.png"><br>


and then opening the posted invoice we will see that the system reports on the document the advanced texts on the customer card plus the Text 4 we added to the order:

It can be deleted by Manage->Delete.
