In the **General** tab of the setup, the following fields have been integrated:

* **Schedule Invoice Creation:** if the flag is set to "true," the system automatically applies this flag to the cumulative billing report (ECS), which will subsequently be initialized with the "scheduled" process queue.
* **Filter Customer:** allows predefined filters to be set on the customer records.
* **Filter Sales Shipment Headers:** allows predefined filters to be set on sales shipments.
* **Minimum Log Level:** allows defining the level of detail required for the billing log.
