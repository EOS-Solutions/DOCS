This allows to set a series of parameters that determine the logic for generating accrual entries:

| Field                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| Accrued Revenue/Deferred Expense Account - Accrued Expense/Deferred Revenue Account | Accrual and deferral accounts to be used in journals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Days per Month                                                | Criterion for allocating the cost/revenue of competence: <br>- 30 days = all months are considered 30 days (Commercial Year)<br>-  Actual days = the actual days of each individual month are considered                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Type                                                           | Allows to select the environment for recording accrual entries.<br>-  G/L = the entries will be posted in the actual accounting (movement of the G/L Entry and printing in the Journal)<br>-  Sim. G/L = the entries will be posted in the simulation environment (Sim. Entries and No printing in the Journal)                                                  |
| Period Type                                                   |  Allows to define the period of competence of the entries generated. Possible values: Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-annual, Annual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Accrual Description Source                            | Allows to define how to handle the posting description in the accrual and deferral detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Posting Description | allows you to specify the description to be applied to accrual and deferral entries when the "Accruals/Deferrals Description Source" field is set to "Fixed Description".
| Allow G/L Entry Grouping                                     | In case it's decided to enable the G/L posting, it allows to establish whether to group, as much as possible, the competence entries generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Account Selection Method | manages the use of accruals and deferrals accounts based on the following options:<br>-  By G/L Source Type: based on the transaction’s Source Type — Customer or Vendor — the entry is treated as income or expense, regardless of whether the amount is positive or negative. <br> - By Amount: accrual and deferral accounts are used based on the sign of the transaction amount. It is treated as an expense if positive, or as income if negative.<br>The By Amount logic is always applied to journal entries where the Source Type of the transaction is not specified.
