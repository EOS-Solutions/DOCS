This allows to set a series of parameters that determine the logic for generating accrual entries:

| Accrued Revenue/Deferred Expense account - Accrued Expense/Deferred Revenue account | Accrual and deferral accounts to be used in journals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Days per month                                                | Criterion for allocating the cost/revenue of competence: <br>- 30 days = all months are considered 30 days (Commercial Year)<br>-  Actual days = the actual days of each individual month are considered                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Type                                                           | Allows to select the environment for recording accrual entries.<br>-  G/L = the entries will be posted in the actual accounting (movement of the G/L Entry and printing in the Journal)<br>-  Sim. G/L = the entries will be posted in the simulation environment (Sim. Entries and No printing in the Journal)                                                  |
| Period Type                                                   |  Allows to define the period of competence of the entries generated. Possible values: Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-annual, Annual.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Credit Memo - Use opposite accounts                            | If activated, the accrual entries generated by a Purchase CM (unlike those related to a Purchase Invoice), will use the accounts set as Active Accruals and/or Passive Deferrals; The accrual entries of a Sales CM (unlike those related to a Sales Invoice), will use the relative accounts set as Passive Accruals and/or Active Deferrals. |
| Accrual description Source                            | Allows to define how to handle the posting description in the accrual and deferral detection.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Allow G/L Entry grouping                                     | In case it's decided to enable the G/L posting, it allows to establish whether to group, as much as possible, the competence entries generated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
