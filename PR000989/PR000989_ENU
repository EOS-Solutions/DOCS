The SGL app integrates the "Entry Type Filter" field in the Column Definitions page; the selectable values are:

- Normal: all movements for the period are included in the column balance, except for those related to the opening/closure of the fiscal year;

- Closure: only the closure entries for the fiscal year are included in the column balance;

- Opening: only the opening entries for the fiscal year are included in the column balance;

- All: all movements are included in the column balance.

**N.B.:**

- To display the opening balance net of the opening entries in the balance sheet, the following setup must be configured: the "Net Change" option in the "Column Type" field and the "Opening" value in the "Entry Type Filter" field;

- The "Entry Type Filter" field does not apply when the financial report is linked to an Analysis View.
