The Intercompany Accounting Eliminations (IAE) App extends the functionality of the BC basic module for the generation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, allowing you to:

• Automatically generate the records for the elimination of debts / credits, intra-group commercial costs / revenues

• Use a standard Excel layout for importing balance sheet balances for non-BC managed companies (through third party software)
