In the Template page (PDA), templates must first be set with the list of tables and fields on which it will be necessary to filter:

By selecting a template, from Edit it is possible to define the tables that you want to edit and the related fields:

For each table it is possible to define the filter to apply. It is advisable to set the data to be filtered between two \#s, so that the system can recognize them and replace them automatically for each new request.

On the templates it is possible to set CUs that carry out checks (e.g. if the invoice being canceled has already been paid or printed in the journal).?  
From Manage-\>Custom Controls you can open the page where you can select the CU of interest.
