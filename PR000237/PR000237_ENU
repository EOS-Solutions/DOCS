All entries related to shipments and/or deliveries are saved within the page ÃDocument invoice entries (SGL).Ä The view allows you to keep track of all shipments and/or deliveries and their corresponding entries applied to invoices and/or credit memos. Any records with the movement type ÃSettlementÄ indicate that the related allocation has been made in G/L (typically at the end of the fiscal year).
