The system allows work requests to be created automatically when a work request is completed. This automatism allows maintenance to be performed not on a pre-established date, but in accordance with a predefined period after the completion of a previously performed work request.

To enable this automation it is necessary edit the maintenance point of a machine as follows:
* Set the period that must elapse between the first maintenance and the next one (DateFormula).
* Enable "Auto-Create Work Request".
* Create the first work request using the "Create Work Request" action.
