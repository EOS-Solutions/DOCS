The **Select billing notes** function allows, as in vendor bills, to manually select the **Billing notes** to be reported in the payment journal lines.<br>
The list is already pre-filtered and shows only the **Billing notes released** that do not have the **On hold** field filled in.

Once the selection has been made, the **Billing notes** will be reported in the journal lines.

The "Document Type" will be Payment and the "External Document No." will show the **Billing Note** No.
