|CONAI Weight Exemption Calc.|The field allows to activate the calculation of the CONAI exemption based on weight. If the flag isn't activated, the exemption percentage is set in the percentage discount in the CONAI charge line.

Enabling the field is useful to improve the app performance when there are many CONAI materials and invoices with many lines.  |
|Enable Calculation on Base Unit of Measure| If enabled, the CONAI is calculated on the item base unit of measure. Otherwise the unit of measure of the document line will be used.  |
