The Accruals and Simulated General Ledger (SGL) app developed by EOS extends the functionality of the General Ledger module in BC. It allows for the automatic creation of self-reversing adjustment entries, including:
- Invoices to be received/emitted for goods and services managed with Purchase Orders (OdA) and Sales Orders (OdV).
- Accruals and deferrals entries.
- Depreciation entries.
The intrayear entries typically feed into the Simulated Accounting environment, which is a parallel ledger to the General Ledger. Simulated Accounting entries do not appear in the Journal and General Ledger Cards.
