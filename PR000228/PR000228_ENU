In this setup, it is possible to define the posting period for simulated entries, specifically related to **accruals and deferrals**.

- **Allow simulated posting from / to**
  These dates allow you to define a period during which you can generate simulated entries, except for those related to **accruals and deferrals**. Periods outside of this range are **not** allowed.
- **Allow accruals/deferrals posting from / to**:
  These dates allow defining a period within which it is possible to generate accrual/deferral entries generated through the indication of the template and the starting/ending dates of competence, **regardless** of what is indicated in the fields **Allow simulated posting from / to**
- **Allow G/L Accruals**
  Specifies which accounts can be accrual. The following values are available:
	- `All Accounts`: all accounts can be accrued, without any limitations. This is the default value.
	- `Income Statement Accounts`: Only income statement accounts can be accrued.
	- `Direct Posting Accounts`: Only accounts that have been marked as direct posting can be accrued. This means having the field **Direct Posting** enabled when accruing into the G/L entry and having either **Direct Posting** or **Sim. Posting** enabled when accruing into the sim. G/L entry.
- **Copy Accrual Information In General Journal**: if this is enabled, fields like the accrual template, period and method are copied from the previous line when inserting a new line to the general journal.
