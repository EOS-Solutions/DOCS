* The "Cost Amount" field in the header indicates the WIP value calculated for the specific order.
* ÃProd. Order Component WipÄ Tab: contains the enhancement of the components used for items not yet stocked in the warehouse as Output (partially or completely). In the example above : 10 pieces were consumed for each component but partial output was recorded (5 out of 10 pieces).
* Prod. Order Routing WIPÄ Tab: contains the enhancement of the capacity movements (run time + setup time) recorded for items not yet stocked in the warehouse as Output (partially or completely). In the example above : Capacity accounting entries were recorded for 122 minutes (total expected to produce 10 pcs) but a partial Output was booked in the warehouse (5 out of 10 pcs). Generally for internal machining, the calculation is carried out according to the declared / actual times, for the Subcontracting according to the pieces.
