**Inventory WIP calculation**

To perform the WIP calculation it is necessary to activate the "Calculate WIP" flag for the period being processed:

After having performed the "Archive Period Data" and "Calculate Actual Data" functions, you can access the "Wip history":

All production orders included in the calculation are shown and, through Manage-> View, you can access the detail card of the single order.

* The "Cost Amount" field in the header indicates the WIP value calculated for the specific order.
* Prod. Order Component Wip Tab: contains the enhancement of the components used for items not yet stocked in the warehouse as Output (partially or completely). In the example above: 10 pieces were consumed for each component but partial output was recorded (8 out of 10 pieces), the WIP quantity is therefore equal to 2.
* Prod. Order Routing WIP” Tab: contains the enhancement of the capacity movements (run time + any setup time) recorded for items not yet stocked in the warehouse as Output (partially or completely). In the example above: Capacity Accounting Entries were recorded for 95 minutes but a partial Output (8 out of 10 pcs) was placed in the warehouse; the expected time to produce 8 pcs would be 72 min, the WIP Time therefore turns out to be 23 min.
Generally, for internal processes, the calculation is based on declared/actual times, while for subcontracting it is based on the number of pieces. The unit rate used in the calculation is determined/retrieved through the following fields in the "Item Cost Setup": "Capacity Cost Calculation" and "WIP - Use Entry Actual Costs"
.
 
**WIP History (IVC)**

The calculated data can be viewed through the Wip History (IVC) report:
