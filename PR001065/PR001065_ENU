The table consists of the following fields:
* Code: indicates the municipal code as defined on the Italian Tax Authority portal
* City: indicates the city corresponding to the municipal code entered in the Code field

It is possible to import a CSV file containing the list of municipal codes using the “Import data from file” function.

* Specify the field delimiter (default ;)
* Indicate whether the first row in the file is a header and therefore should not be imported
