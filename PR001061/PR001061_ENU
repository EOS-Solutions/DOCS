# Web services setup
The app requires the creation and use of some additional web services beyond those standard in LS Central.
It is therefore necessary to first publish these web services in the head office and then create the Web Services v2.0 setup as required by LS Central.

# Web Service V2.0
After correctly creating and publishing the web services as described in the previous section, it is necessary to register these web services under Web Requests 2.0.
Then, access the LS Central web services setup.
