### Activation of Surplus Settlement Reverse:

In the **Bonus Setup (SPB)**, it is possible to enable the management of surplus write-offs directly from settlement without generating an accounting write-off document:

On the contract lines, there are functions to view the following:
* Bonus accounting movements
* Settlement movements
* Surplus settlement movements (to be accrued)

When a settled amount includes a surplus (to be accrued), there are two options:

**Option 1**: Write-off of the surplus only, followed by the full settlement write-off

* With the "*write off surplus settlement*" flag set to true in the bonus setup, the surplus write-off function in the "*surplus movements*" allows you to reverse the movement without generating an accounting document by unchecking the "*Create document*" flag in the write-off report:

* Setting the "Create document" flag to false allows you to reverse the surplus without generating an accounting write-off document.

* The system will close the surplus, restoring the settlement to its original value:

**Option 2**: Write-off of the full settlement (including surplus):

* Starting with a settlement that includes a surplus, you can access the settlement movements (NOT surplus movements).

* Using the write-off function, reverse the movements related to the invoice you want to settle (it is not necessary to select all movements; selecting just one linked to that document number is sufficient):

* With a single action, both the settlement and the surplus (to be accrued) will be reversed:
