It is possible to define the status changes by clicking on Status Transactions ; for example I can define the workflow from New to Certificated and the actions to do before moving from one status to another.

| Field                  | Description                                                       |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| From status            | The initial status must be set as Blank-\>New.                    |
| Skip permission checks |  if set to TRUE anyone can make the corresponding status change.  |
