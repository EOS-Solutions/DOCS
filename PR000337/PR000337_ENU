The system allows the automatic creation of work requests spaced between them by a predetermined period. Unlike automatic creation at the end of a work request, this automation immediately creates all work requests in the specified date range and spaced as defined in the maintenance point.

To activate this automation, it is necessary to change the maintenance point of a machine as follows:
* Set the "Start Date" and "End Date" as the range of dates during which maintenance is to be performed.
* Set in the "Periodicity" field the period that must elapse between the first maintenance and the next maintenance (DateFormula).
* Create work requests using the "Create Work Request" action.
