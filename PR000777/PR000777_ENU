Service configurations allow you to specify parameters and configuration for external services through a single common interface. EOS Administration Library provides support for a number of services out-of-the box, but you can easily implement your own service configurations with minimal effort and leverage this common configuration interface.

For each service configuration there usually exists a Codeunit for accessing this service. You can refer to the documentation of that specific service for details.

See below for a list of supported services.
