**Expenses reporting**

Expenses are recorded together with hours in a dedicated area of ​​the time sheet. 

To report travel expenses on a project, open the EOS Time Sheet List and select the time sheet of interest. By inserting the project in the time sheet line, the system proposes the expenses in the Time Sheet Expense Lines as set in the project's travel agreements. 

*NB. Expenses vary based on the type of trip (outward, return, outward&return, travel) and based on what set in the travel agreements.*

In this case, although the travel agreements have a double line of expenses (one for the outward journey and one for the return), in expense sheet lines the expense is proposed once thanks to the Not Accumulable on O/R flag set on return-type lines (in travel agreements).
