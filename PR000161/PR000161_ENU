**Note**<br>
If the fields "Account Type" and "Account No." are filled in the journal with customer or vendor references, the offset page will automatically open filtered by the customer/vendor code entered.


### Compensation Page
The offset page displays the customer/vendor entries to be offset based on the filters applied.
It is possible to filter the entries displayed using the following parameters:
* Open/Closed entries
* Posting date
* Payment method code
* Currency code

The compensation page will display customer and vendor ledger entries according to the filters set.

### Compensation Methods
**Manual Application**<br>
It is possible to manually select the entries to be offset using the "Selected" field.

When an entry is selected, the fields "Applied Amount" and "Applied Amount (LCY)" are automatically populated.


**Note**<br>
Even if the "Applied Amount" field is automatically filled with an amount higher than the remaining amount (as it is based on the available balance), during the posting proposal the value will be automatically adjusted.


<br>**Automatic Application (Comp. Sel. Customer Entries/Comp. Sel. Vendor Entries)**<br>
Using the "Comp. Sel. Customer Entries"/"Comp. Sel. Vendor Entries" actions, an automatic application proposal is generated, based on customer/vendor entries sorted by ascending due date.

<br>**"Balance" Mode**<br>
If only entries from one section are selected (e.g., Customer section) and the "Suggest Application Lines" action is executed, the system will propose the settlement of the selected entries and insert a single balancing line in the opposite section (Vendor in the example), without applying it to any entry.

The compensation is executed only if the final balance of the destination party does not become negative.

### Create Journal Lines
The "Create Journal Lines" action proposes the offset of the selected entries.
As mentioned above, when only entries from one section are selected ("balance" mode), the system suggests the closing lines for the selected entries and one balancing posting line in the opposite section.

### Open Journal Batch.
The "Open Journal Batch" action allows accessing the batch used for the offset postings.


### Clear All
The "Clear All" action clears the selections made, allowing you to make new selections for the offset.
