<br>**Procedure**
1. The SDD file is created in Business Central from "Customer Bill Card".
1. Upon maturity, wait for the bank to process the results, then download the SDD unpaid file from Remote Banking.
1. **Import the unpaid file into Business Central using the “SEPA DD Dishonored (CBI)” function and post the accounting entries.**
1. Run the “Closing Bank Receipts” procedure to apply the invoice with the payment entry (the procedure is the same as that used for closing bank receipts).

Closing must occur after posting the unpaid bills, as the unpaid import assumes the related entry is still open. If few unpaid bills exist, you can close them at maturity and manually reopen them before importing
