Maintenance cycles allow to define a checklist of activities to be do to perform maintenance on a machine.
For each of the maintenance cycle lines, you can specify:
* **Position**. Which defines the order in which the operation must be performed.
* **Parameter No.**. Defines the operation that must be performed within the maintenance cycle. The parameters, which are not mandatory, can be added in the appropriate table.
* **Type**. Together with the **Type No.** it defines who the operation is assigned to. The permitted values are: **Resource**, **Resource Group**.
* **Type No.**. See **Type**.
* **Description**. Operation description.
* **Unit of Measure Code**.
* **Cap. Unit of Measure Code**.
* **Maintenance Duration**. 
* **Next Operation No.**. It can be used together with the **Previous Operation No.** to make the maintenance cycle serial or parallel.   
* **Previous Operation No.**. It can be used together with the **Next Operation No.** to make the maintenance cycle serial or parallel.


For each of the lines it is possible to manage:
* **Comments**.
* **Resolution Codes**. Resolution codes allow to define a list of possible responses in the activity progress statement and a follow up action to be performed. The following actions are permitted: **Create Work Request (Copy)**, **Create Fast Work Request**, **Create Work Request (Default Maintenance Point No.)**, **Create Work Request (Interactive)**.

For each maintenance cycle it is possible to manage n versions, each with its own validity start date.

The maintenance cycle must be in **Certified** status before being used.

The maintenance cycle and its version can be associated with a maintenance point. When creating work requests, if indicated, they are automatically inherited.

In the Plant Maintenance Setup (PMM) there is a field called **Use Work Req. Cycle Posting** which, if enabled, allows to use the work request cycle movements to suggest the values to post.

The use of maintenance cycles even with a single activity is recommended.
