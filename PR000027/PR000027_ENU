The Eos SolutionsÂ Close Documents Without Invoicing (CDW) app allows you to:

-   Generate system Shipments and Sales Returns, Receipts and Purchase Return Shipments that do not require the issuance of the related Invoice or Credit Note document
-   Generate sales and purchase documents that, even in the presence of ÃItemÄ Type lines, do not move the stock and the value of the item itself
-   Generate sales documents that do not feed the various tables related to ÃLedger entryÄ (non-administrative documents).
