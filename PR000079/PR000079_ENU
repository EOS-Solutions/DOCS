The EOS ®Advanced Intrastat For Italy (ITR)¯ app uses some standard setups, integrating them with app-specific setups.

On the Intrastat Setup page, set a numerator and grouping type:

- ÃPer LineÄ: each single line is reported in the Intrastat declaration.
- ÃPer DocumentÄ: the lines in the Intrastat Declaration are grouped by nomenclature and by document.
