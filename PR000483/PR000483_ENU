To create reminders, you can **run a report** or use the appropriate **action on the Delivery Reminders (PDR) page.**

The **default** setting for Posting and Document Date is **Workdate** .

The **Posting Date is used as a reference date** for the calculation of the days related to the levels. If you select "**Only overdue orders**" on the reminder, the lines relating to orders that have yet to expire will not appear.

You can filter by specific vendor or run the report on all suppliers.

NB The document level is always used. The header level is not managed.

**Reminder example**

At the bottom there is the list of orders that have yet to expire.

In the header, the "Reminder level" field shows the degree to which we have reached in soliciting orders from the vendor.
