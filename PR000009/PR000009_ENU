The Enasarco Foundation ([www.enasarco.it)](http://www.enasarco.it/) provides the social security and assistance of salespersons and trade representatives.

**Introduction**

The Enasarco FIRR and FISC (CMS) Eos Solutions app allows you to manage the calculation and registration of agent contributions in accordance with applicable regulations through:

-   Assigning contribution parameters to vendors/agents
-   Calculating contributions for Enasarco, F.I.R.R., F.I.S.C.
-   Posting calculated contributions to accounting
-   Ability to intervene with changes and fixes
-   Exporting the "Grandi Ditte" file through specific bill
-   Easy application of vendor entries related to contributions to vendor entries related to purchase document posting

The Enasarco FIRR and FISC app is based on the Commissions app: the taxable basis for calculating contributions is represented by commissions, that are yet settled or to be settled. For this reason, the contribution management is also identified by the acronym CMS. 

| **N.B.**                                                                                                    |
