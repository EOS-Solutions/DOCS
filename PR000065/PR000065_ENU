Some features of the Advanced Document Reporting App require a subscription.

The subscription can be activated from Subscription control panel or directly from the notification messages that the system proposes, by clicking on the link that allows you to start the subscription wizard. In particular:

* **FREE** version : the user can print all the reports included and modify the general setup. It is not possible to modify the advanced setups that allow the customization and / or the massive sending.

* **PRO** version : all features are active. The pro-version enable access to report sources, allowing further customization.
