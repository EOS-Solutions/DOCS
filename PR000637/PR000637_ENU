### **Filter - Customer**

The customer filter allows specifying filtering parameters for customer master data. For example, if you want to invoice only customers with a specific "Invoicing Method Code," such as **1SHIP1INV**, you can enter it directly in the dedicated field.

### **Filter - Sales Shipment Headers**

The filter on sales shipment headers allows starting extended cumulative invoicing for a specific set of billable shipments.  

**Note:**  
If CWS shipments are active, filter using the field **"CWS Shipment No."**; if they are not active, use the field **"No."**

If a specific invoicing method has been set up in the customer master data (Billing tab), selecting that method in the report will enable filtering for all customers to whom it has been assigned.
