On the **EDI Message List** page, all created and imported messages can be viewed.

To open one use the menu **Manage** -> **View**.

The information present is: EDI Group and Message Type, Message Creation Date, Serial No., Created ÁOnÂ and ÁFromÂ, Document Referenced and Reference Date and Message Status.

From here you can:

- Retry to export the file if the export has previously failed using the **Export** action.
- Retry to convert the message into a Business Central document if it previously failed using the **Accept** action.
- Navigate to the related Business Central documents using the **Documents** action.
- Check the error log of this single message using the **Log** action.
- See the files related to this message using the **Files** action.
- **Cancel** the document because it is no longer needed and thus remove it from the list.
