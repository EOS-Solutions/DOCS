This setup avoids generating elisions for accounts that do not concern the consolidated financial statements: for example, on an accounting entry for the collection of a loan from a subsidiary company, the Intercompany dimension will be valued both on the loan account and on that of the bank. The elision entry however, it must only be generated for the loan account.
