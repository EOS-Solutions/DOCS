The characteristics are a fundamental data for the use of the configurator. They are the starting unit of the entire configuration structure and conceptually correspond to the questions that must be asked during configuration. They are used to identify variants or items created by the configurator.

They can be of two types:
-   **Structure:** characteristics that take a defined list of pre-encoded alphanumeric or numeric values;
-   **Measure:** characteristics that accept only free-entry numeric values.

Below is a detail of the main fields present in the characteristics:

| **Field**                    | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code |Characteristic code.|
| Description |Characteristic description.|
| Max Length |Can only be used with structure type characteristics. Prevents a characteristic from taking more characters than indicated.|
| Decoding Type |Allowed values are Structure and Measure. **Structure**: characteristics that take a defined list of pre-encoded alphanumeric or numeric values. **Measure**: characteristics that accept only free-entry numeric values.|
| Without values |CAllows to use a structure characteristic without specifying a predefined list of values.|
| Acronym |Is used to compose the item description before any characteristic value code or description. There are two ways to configure an item's description: **1.** as defined by the rule using the ÃFormat DescriptionÄ and ÃFormat Description 2Ä fields. **2.** configurator uses all characteristics code and description based on these settings: ÃUse CodeÄ and ÃUse DescriptionÄ fields in characteristics and characteristics values tables.|
| Use Description |If active, the configurator uses the description of the characteristic value for the creation of the item description.|
| Use Code |If active, the configurator uses the characteristic value for the creation of the item description.|
| Master |Indicates that the values of one characteristic can be used by other characteristics.|
| Connection |The value of a master characteristic must be indicated. Use the "Align Connection" action to update the other values.|
| Surcharge Type |Type used to insert the surcharge line. The allowed values are G/L Account, Item, Resource, Fixed Asset, Charge (Item).|
| Surcharge No. |Code used to insert the surcharge line.|
| Disable Linked Characteristic Copy |Used for master characteristics with connection. By activating this field, the Align Connections function does not value the "Linked Characteristic Code" and "Linked Characteristic Value" fields in the connected characteristics. In the presence of multiple characteristics that insist on the same connected characteristic it is very useful.|
| Dimension Code |Enabled only when configuring items. If this field is not empty, the dimension is inherited by the newly created item.|
| Dimension Value Code |Enabled only when configuring items. If this field is not empty, the dimension value is inherited by the newly created item.|
| Value Posting |Determines how dimensions are handled.|
| Step |Only for characteristics of type ®measure¯, it is only used by the batch configuration. Determines the increment for characteristics of type ®measure¯.|
| Numeric Format |Specifies the expression used to format the code in AL language (for example, Precision and Standard Format). It is only used for relations of type ®higher level¯, in order to customize how to format characteristics of type ®structure¯ calculated by a formula.|
| Attribute ID |Specifies the Attribute ID. Used for the mapping between characteristics and attributes.|
| Attribute Value |Specifies the Attribute Value. Used for the mapping between characteristics and attributes.|

Below is a detail of the main fields present in the characteristic values:

| **Field**                    | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code  |Value characteristic code.|
| Description |Value characteristic description.|
| Acronym |In case thereÂs an acronym, the characteristic value description is replaced by it in the item description, and the characteristic code is replaced by it in the item code.|
| Use Description |If active, the configurator uses the description of the characteristic value for the creation of the item description. ItÂs inherited by the characteristic and can be disabled for each value.|
| Use Code |If active, the configurator uses the characteristic value for the creation of the item description. itÂs inherited by the characteristic and can be disabled for each value.|
| Linked Characteristic Code |Used with Linked Characteristic Value. When compiled, the configuration makes a 1:1 transfer of the values on this characteristic, without having to specify a relation of type transfer value.|
| Linked Characteristic Value |Used with Linked Characteristic Code. When compiled, the configuration makes a 1:1 transfer of the values on this characteristic, without having to specify a relation of type transfer value.|
| Neutral Rule Characteristic Code |Used with Neutral Rule Characteristic Value. When compiled with a neutral rule present, these are used instead of the characteristic to search for the fix code.|
| Neutral Rule Characteristic Value |Used with Neutral Rule Characteristic Value. When compiled with a neutral rule present, these are used instead of the characteristic to search for the fix code.|
| Purchase Item No. |Defines the fix purchase item that should be replaced by the ®Item from neutral to fix¯ in the configured BOM.|
| Enable routing |When active, specifies that the characteristic value conditions the line of the configured routing. Enables business logic for fields: Source Type, Source No., Run Time Factor, Standard Task Code.|
| Source Type |The routing line can be created as Work Center or Machine Center.|
| Source No. |Work center code or Machine center Code to be used in the routing according to the Source Type.|
| Run Time Factor |Factor used to calculate the run time of the routing line.|
| Standard Task Code |Standard Task Code to be used in routing line.|
| Optional Item No. |defines the optional item to use for that characteristic value. The Optional Item Spec. Table is needed when we need to specify different optionals for different neutral items.|
| Optional Item Quantity |Multiplier that identifies the optional quantity.|
| Blocked |When active, the characteristic value is hidden.|
| Dimension Code |Enabled only when configuring items. If this field is not empty, the dimension is inherited by the newly created item.|
| Dimension Value Code |Enabled only when configuring items. If this field is not empty, the dimension value is inherited by the newly created item.|
| Value Posting |Determines how dimensions are handled.|
| Attribute ID |Specifies the Attribute ID. Used for the mapping between characteristic values and attributes.|
| Attribute Value |Specifies the Attribute Value. Used for the mapping between characteristic values and attributes.
| Sorting Code |defines a priority for the value. When two or more characteristics trigger the direct validation of a third characteristic, the system prioritizes the one with the biggest sorting code.|
