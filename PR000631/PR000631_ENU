In the extended cumulative billing setup (ECS), fields and configurations related to the three new implemented features have been integrated:

* **ECS Error Log Management:** integrated with the "Billing Sessions (ECS)" page, where it is possible to view the billing log with various levels of detail.
* **Management of Data Security Status:** integrates the ability to advance provisional sales invoices generated by ECS to a specific status identified by the setup, which can be subjected to standard EDS field controls.
* **Assigning a Specific Document Class:** integrates the ability to assign a dedicated document class to the sales invoices generated by the ECS billing process.

Additionally, it is necessary to select a default setup code to use in case a specific one is not indicated in the Customer record.

On the **Customer Setup** in the “Invoicing” Tab you can in fact define the billing method for each individual Customer.

If this field is not filled in, the system considers the one indicated in the Extended Cumulative Invoices Setup.
