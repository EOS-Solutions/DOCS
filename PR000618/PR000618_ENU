* **Personnel in routings**

It is possible to insert **one or more "Personnel" work centers within a routing**.

It is possible to indicate a specific Unit Cost for the processing cycle diifferent from the cost attributed in the personnel masterdata.  

E.g. for the TREKPRO routing we select the "Verniciatura (Painting)" work center and from **Operation-> Personnel** we can get the details on the people who work for this center:

Specifically, we have defined that in the Painting work center there are people who take care of the actual painting and some equipment installers who follow the setup instead.

NB Setup Time, Run Time and Concurrent Capacities are used by the system for cost calculation.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Time Type | the Personal area is associated with a capacity expressed in terms of time, based on the corresponding Type of Time: Setup Time, Run Time, Wait Time, Move Time, Queue Time. |
| Percentage | indicates the percentage of employment of the personnel (one person is employed for the painting, for 50% of their working time. The setup is followed by two people, each of whom takes all their working time.) |

* **Tools in routings**

It is possible to insert one or more "Tool" Work Center within a routing . The equipment is associated with one or more Time Type, based on the time it is used, including: Setup Time, Run Time, Wait Time, Move Time, Queue Time.
