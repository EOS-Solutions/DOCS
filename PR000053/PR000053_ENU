<br>
The System will open a new e-mail window with the fields *Sender* and *Recipient* pre-filled according to the field *`PEC Email`* in the Customer card. If the field *`PEC Email`* is empty, the system will not add the recipient to the e-mail.
<br><br>
You can then write a text and / or attach documents and finally send.
