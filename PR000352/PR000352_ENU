In the VAT Posting setup, the "EU Service" field determines whether the movement will be charged to the Intra goods or Intra services section; the criterion is the following:

Field not checked =\> GOODS

Field checked =\> SERVICES

When you check EU Service, the system also automatically turns on the ®Service Tariff No. Mandatory¯ field, this check must be removed.

There is also the possibility of excluding a particular combination from the intrastat by using the specific "Exclude from Intrastat" flag.
