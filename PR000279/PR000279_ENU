When there are several characteristics with the same values, it is possible to define a ®**Master**¯ characteristic that stores the default values, and the other characteristics can be defined as ®**Connected**¯ to the first one, so they can utilize the same set of values.

In order to synchronize the available values of a connected characteristic from the master, select the master characteristic and click on the action ®**Align Connection**¯.

**The alignment can have an impact on system performance and should be scheduled when the number of characteristics and values to synchronize is high.**

**Having a master characteristic with connected characteristics helps reducing the activities of classification and maintenance.**
