Premise: Typically, in destination-based invoicing, it is necessary to first verify the project logic used to set up destinations/delivery points in the customer master data.

Usually, the "shipping addresses" master data is used. However, in some cases, particularly in the retail sector, due to pricing or promotional logic specific to delivery points, a structure is chosen that uses the "Sell-to Customer" master data associated with a single billing customer "Bill-to Customer," corresponding to the parent company. In this case, the splitting criterion "Sell-to Customer No." must be flagged to generate one invoice per delivery point.

In this case, in the invoicing report, we will include the billing method code filter: MENS-DEST, which provides a split by "Ship-to Address."

In this example, two invoices have been generated containing:

* **First Invoice:** 2 Shipments with destination VITERBO
* **Second Invoice:** 1 Shipment with destination ROME
