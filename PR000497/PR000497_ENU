**Prepayment Setup**

The prepayment amount in percentage or fixed amount is determined on the Salesperson/Purchaser Card::

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000497-0/CommAdvAlloc1.png"><br>

The percentage is applied to the amount of the commission on sales documents registered during the month, for agents with Partial or Total settlement.

-   % Prepayment: a record is created for each combination of Line / Invoice / Credit Note - due date. The Document No. is inherited from the Invoice / Credit Note that generated it.
-   Prepayment Amount (LCY): a record is created for each salesperson with Due Date equal to thePosting Date. The two calculation methods are alternatives to one another.

In both cases opposite record will also be generated with reason code "prepayment reversal." The document number will coincide with that of the prepayment that generated it.

**Commission Advance Calculation (CMS)**

To calculate the advances you have to launch the report Commission Advance Calculation (CMS):

The system shows how many salespersons have been processed and how many lines have been created in a message.

In the Commission Payable journal are then created the following commission entries to be settled:

On posting, the system will create Commission advances entries.

**Commission Cost Allocation (CMS)**

The "Commission cost allocation (CMS)" procedure allows you to generate the following periodic accounting / simulated entry:

Accrued commission expense (CE) @ Commission expense to be paid (SP - Liabilities).

The accounts handled are present in the "Commissions" tab of the Salespeople / Purchasers master data.

**Commissions Setup (CMS)**

In the "Allocation" section of the Commissions Setup it is necessary to fill in the following parameters:
