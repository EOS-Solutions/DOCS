It is possible to post the WIP in simulated accounting during the year, and in general accounting at the end of the year. 

You can detect WIP in simulated accounting during the year, and in general accounting at the end of the year. 

Firstly, it is always necessary to detect provisional WIP entries: by launching the provisional WIP report, the calculations are performed based on the selections set.

The system will store the calculated WIP values in the Project WIP entries. 

Once you have verified that the calculated amounts are correct, you can bring them into simulated accounting through the following report:

For the purposes of correct recording of periodic skills in simulation, using the same report it is possible to reverse by enabling the “Reversal only” field.

The “Reversal date” field allows you to indicate a different reversal date. 

You can then proceed with the simulated detection of the following period, repeating the same steps. 


The Project WIP G/C Entries will be periodically marked as reversed, since the system calculation logic is Year to date.

This report also allows you to write in compressed mode, by enabling the “Compress” flag.
