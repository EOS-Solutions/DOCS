* **Measurable**: parameters that require measurable detection.
* **Attributes**: parameters that do not require measurable detection.

	Attributes can have different parameter types:

	- Actual value: deprecated

	- Parameter attribute code: the analysis can give different and tabular results (e.g. yellow, green, red colour...)

	- Attribute Fulfilled: the analysis can be positive or negative

It is possible to define the unit of measurement in Unit of Measure Code and possibly the Measure Method.
