A **production BOM** is **configurable** when it is **associated to an item** with Configuration Type "**Neutral to Configuration**". The configuration process automatically creates a BOM for each new item configured (with "Production Order" replenishment system) as a copy of the neutral BOM.

If there is no configuration logic for individual rows in the BOM, the neutral BOM is modified without any changes.

The **lines in a BOM** are configurable if:

-   They contain "Neutral to Configuration" items;
-   They contain ÃNeutral to Fix" items;
-   They contain quantity formulas and/or conditions;

<br>

The first way to configure the lines of a production BOM is through the presence of configurable semi-finished products.

The configurator allows to automate the creation of the structure of an item, i.e. the automatic creation of semi-finished items, bills of materials and routings.

It is important to keep in mind that **the configurator follows a "cascade" or top-down logic**. Characteristics are always transmitted from the level 0 item to sublevels and never vice versa.

The transmission takes place in the following ways:

-   **Automatically**: When the same characteristic exists in the secondary level as in the primary level. There is no need to establish logic.
-   **Default characteristics**: When there is a characteristic in the secondary level that does not exist in the primary level and its value is always fixed.
-   **With ®Higher level¯ relations:** When there is a characteristic in the secondary level that does not exist in the primary level, and the logic must be defined.

<br>
To have an item **automatically configured** by the configuration of the parent item it is necessary:

1.  Assign it a configuration type "Neutral to Configuration";
2.  Assign it a rule that has an associated set of characteristics that could be a subset of those of the parent or even different (in which case higher level relations are required);
3.  Insert it into the BOM of the parent item.
