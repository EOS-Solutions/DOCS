**The new setup wizard function, present in the Packaging Setup and in the onboarding procedure, must be used in a DEMO or TEST environment and allows you to create demonstration data to start using the packing list.
In particular, packaging materials, packaging instructions, Handling units and a sales order are created from which it is possible to manage and print the packing list.**

The setup wizard creates the following main information:
** Packaging Setup (HUM) **

Finally the **packaging instructions** are created:

Packaging instructions are used to define how items are packed into handling units. The packaging instructions are used to suggest the packing list for the document.

The user is then asked **Do you want to create a new Sales Order and the packing list**? If the answer is yes setup create a sales order:
