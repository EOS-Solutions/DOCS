The Eos Solutions Advanced Document Reporting App allows you to create and print up to 20 different types of documents using only 5 reports . For the same document it is also possible to define different layouts, by editing the document  header, the footer, the report title (for example for Proforma Invoices or "for internal use") through setup.
The Advanced Document Reporting App extends the standard functionality of sending e-mail documents: it allows for example to define advanced setups related to the recipients and the body of the email through extended texts or HTML templates. It is possible, for example, to indicate that the sales invoices are sent massively not only to the email address of the customer card, but also to contacts with specified professional roles.

**User benefits**
The advantages for the user are:

* a single report to print multiple document types
* possibility to print the pdf files and send them by e-mail
