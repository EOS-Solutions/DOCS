The app includes a graphical interface, but it only works on newer versions of Windows. On older systems, the interface may not start.

When the interface is not available, you can always use the **GIN** command-line tool. GIN works on all supported Windows versions.

If the UI doesn’t open, just run GIN instead.

## Supported Versions

The UI works on:

* Windows 11
* Windows 10
* Windows Server 2022

The UI does **not** work on:

* Windows Server 2016

On any version where the UI does not work, you can always use **GIN**.
