In addition, it is possible to define the exchange options:

* Exchange Component

* Exchange Quantity

* Exchange Scrap

* Exchange Routing Link

* Exchange Position

You can create the new version already in Certified status and force a new version start date.

At the end, the lines do not disappear from the report, but have the flag **Processed** active.

If a BOM is already certified, for allowing editing it is put on "Under Development" state. 
Only if "Certify Bom" request page flag is enabled, modified BOM is certified. 

To make any type of change, the BOM must be in an editable state, such as **"New"** or **"Under Development"**.
If the BOM is in the **"Certified"** state, it is automatically set to **"Under Development"** from the component worksheet to allow for changes.
Once changes are complete, the BOM is certified only if the **"Certify Bom"** flag is enabled on the request page; otherwise, it remains in the edit state.
