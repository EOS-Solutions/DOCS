**Setup**

On the CDW Setup page you can choose between the options:

* The flag “*Delete doc…*”: it impacts invoice posting from orders. If enabled, it deletes the respective fully invoiced order; otherwise, the order is not deleted.

* The option “*Reason code check*”: specifies how the changes made to posting setups in a reason code are checked against the existing posted documents in the current accounting period.
