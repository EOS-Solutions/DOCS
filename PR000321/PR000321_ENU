The points from which you can configure an item are:

-   Items
-   Sales documents (quotes, orders, invoices)
-   Purchase documents (quotes, orders)
-   Transfer orders
-   Released and confirmed production orders
-   Project (job) planning lines
-   Production BOM and Assembly BOM

To configure from the documents just **enter the neutral item code** in the No. field and the configuration starts automatically.

You can re-enter the configuration by selecting the "Configurator" function or the shortcut Ctrl+G.
