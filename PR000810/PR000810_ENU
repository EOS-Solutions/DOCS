The table allows to associate with the resource, within the project team: 

* *Job title* 

* *Project team role*: the roles will have to be codified on the system 

* *Time posting*: allows the resource to register hours and expenses on the project 

* *Invoice suggestion*: the possibility of re-invoicing the customer for the hours and expenses charged by the resource
