By choosing to **send** the electronic document, the system generates an .Xml file and sends it to IX. In the posted sales invoice list there is the Status field which shows the [Status of the electronic document returned by IX](https://docs.eos-solutions.it/en/docs/apps-func/electronic-invoice-for-italy/electronic-invoice-for-italy-ixfe-status.html).

By choosing to **create** the electronic document, the system creates an .Xml file that is linked to the invoice header in the Electronic Document Tab:

| NB Some data for the XML file are essential, but are not essential to BC for the posting of the document. The 3 main cases are: VAT Number or Fiscal Code: if the document is posted without VAT Number or Fiscal Code the system allows you to add the data in the customer card and to export the document again with the correct data; Payment method: if the document does not have the payment method, the TAG is added to the generated file which can be populated manually directly in the file; Payment terms: if the document does not have the payment terms, the TAG is added to the generated file which can be populated manually directly in the file;   |

**Extended Combine Shipment (ECS)**

The invoices generated with this app additional app can be initialized with a specific Electrnic Document Type set in the setup options:

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000510-0/39ElectronicInvoiceForItaly.png"><br>

Being the Electronic Doc.Type also present in the sales order header it becomes a grouping criteria available in the billing methods. In this case the system will generate different invoices when the field changes, by initializing the value of type Doc. Electronic invoice with the one retrieved from the orders; if specified in the launch parameters of a default value to be assigned, this will override the one inherited from the order.

**Electronic Document Transmission Status**

On the Sales Invoice List / Posted Cr. Memo List you can check the STATUS of the electronic document.

This field allows you to monitor the IX-FE status for a document (notifications on conservation are excluded). It is shown, for example, if the document was created, validated, etc.

Clicking on the status field the system opens the OUTBOUND ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT STATUS LOG. From Actions you can, for a specific document, suspend the IX-FE notification update by setting the "Disable Notifications" option.
