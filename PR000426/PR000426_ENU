The Product Configurator also allows you to configure **Assembly BOMs**.

The following fields have been introduced in the Assembly BOM:

-   Formula Quantity
-   Formula Code
-   Condition Code

To configure an item with Assembly BOM it is necessary to set it up as:

-   **Configuration Type ®**Neutral to Configuration¯
-   **Rule** Configuration
-   **Replenishment System:** Assembly

The product configuration phase is identical to the classic configurator, with the difference that, at the end of the configuration, an assembly BOMis generated.

To the advantage of using the assembly BOM, it is emphasized that:

-   It can also be used **without using the APP ®Product Configurator for manufacturing**¯
-   It can also be used with the **Essential Experience**
-   When used with the Premium Experience and the Product Configurator for Manufacturing app, it gives the possibility to use both Assembly and Production BOMs.

Disadvantage:

-   **It does not support** configuration of **Variants** because the standard BC does not provide assembly lists for variant codes.
