**Gordon PowerShell** is the PowerShell-Version of Gordon, a module designed to streamline and automate tasks related to managing Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC) services, applications, and development environments.

- **DevOps Teams**: Integrate Gordon PowerShell with CI/CD tools like Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions for automated deployment and testing pipelines.
