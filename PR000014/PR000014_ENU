The system connected the entry "124.04 euros" and closed it. The line "1000 euro" remains open for 875.96 euros. 

 

Close and press Post.

In General Ledger Entries, filtering by G/L Account No. entries we can verify the posted lines: the system has linked four accounting items (closing them) to the main accounting item, leaving it open for 592.83 euros.
