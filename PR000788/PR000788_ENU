Using the "Field Mapping (OBN)" table, it is possible to dynamically define, for each bank, how to feed the content of the information fields in the Payment Reconciliation Record form.
It is possible to map some source fields of the Open Banking Movements table with the destination fields of the Payment Reconciliation Record form.

* Name of the related party,
* Address of the related party,
* City of the related party,
* Bank account number of the related party,

The mapping can be differentiated by:
* Current account number
* Type
* Operation type
* Transaction owner code
