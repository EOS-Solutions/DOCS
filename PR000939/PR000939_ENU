The standard solution in Business Central is based on the mechanism whereby a child company subscribes to data change events on one and only one "Parent" company and then inherits the changes from a single source that must necessarily reside on the same database and therefore share the same localization, the same apps and customizations.

 Communication is one-way from "Parent" to "Child" and synchronization takes place only on a scheduled basis.

Each synchronization setup must be performed on the company receiving the data and manually replicated on the other companies.

The EOS MDI Master data intercompany app offers two basic setup modes:

**"LOCAL"**: transfers the changes from one or more MASTER companies to the daughter companies as long as they reside in the same database. The Master company notifies the changes synchronously or asynchronously to the daughter companies which update the data through a scheduled activity. Communication is two-way.

**"SOAP / OAUTH2"**:transfers changes from ONE or MORE MASTER companies to daughter companies on any local or remote database, OnPremise or OnLine even if they operate on different localizations and mount different apps and different customizations. The Master company notifies the changes synchronously or asynchronously to the daughter companies which update the data. Communication is two-way. The setup of tables and fields to be synchronized are managed on the "parent" company, making configuration, copying and modification of the settings easier and faster.

The EOS MDI app is suitable both for small companies with a few companies to synchronize and for larger and more complex realities where it is necessary to transform data during synchronization (currencies, languages) in multinational contexts and with many companies to synchronize. It also offers specific features for:

-   Restrict editability of data on child companies

-   Monitor sync status with consolidated and cross-company views

-   Synchronize chart of accounts

-   Sync dimensions

-   Manual and selective synchronizations of subsets of data

-   Copy and duplicate sync profiles
