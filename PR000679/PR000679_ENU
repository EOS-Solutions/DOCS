The Sales and Purchase Bonus (SPB) app allows you to

- Create contracts and contract conditions for individual customers or hierarchical groups
- Calculate the amount of bonuses to be paid to your customers or recognised by your suppliers
- Verify settlement amounts via a reconciliation tool
- Allocate costs for the recognition of accruing bonuses
- Manage a periodic forecast of bonuses

The Sales and Purchase Bonus app makes it possible to schedule the calculation of bonuses outside working hours so as not to block the company's operations during the process.

You can utilise the flexibility of contract logics for the management of recognition thresholds and/or differences in turnover based on history.

Calculation errors are reduced through the use of the reconciliation dashboard of movements to be settled and invoices/credit notes to be issued/received.
