Once the handling unit is created, this unit can be used and assigned to sales / purchase documents. For example, let's create a Sales Order. After inserting one or more item on the lines, from the specific Factbox on the right we assign them a Handling Unit:

| **Action** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| Card |opens the Handling Unit card indicated in the No. field |
| New | it allows to create a new Handling Unit |
| Assign | it allows you to choose the unit to assign to the document |
| Unassign | it allows you to unlink the chosen unit |

<br>
After selecting the handling unit, the system will automatically fill in the Quantity to be shipped on the lines (based on how many pieces the handling unit can contain)

From each Handling unit card, from **Related->Assignments** the system shows which order the unit has been assigned to, for which item and quantity.

<tr>
<th>NB</th>

<tr>
<td>"Source No" field  shows the list of documents to which the unit has been assigned</td>
</tr>
</table>

<br>

Now you can post the shipment.

On the shipment there will be a Facbox indicating the unit with the status "Shipped".

By opening the Handling Unit card from **Related-> Entries** it will be possible to view the item entries for the unit.
