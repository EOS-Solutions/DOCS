From New it is possible to create a new inspection plan in which you need to specify parameters to be considered while testing goods and also you need to enter the expected values. Then you can choose the devices to be used in the checks. See Planning.

**Frequency**

This field is used if you want to assign a frequency to the row.

Options:
