The **EBN – Billing Note** App allows the management of proforma invoices for professionals subject to withholding tax and, more generally, the management of advance payments for Italian or foreign vendors in euros and in currency.

This app therefore allows the insertion and archiving of proforma invoices/billing notes for all types of vendors: national or foreign, subject or not to withholding tax and to arrange payment both in euros and in currency.

**Relations with the DCF – “DocFinance connector” app**

The management of proforma invoices, albeit in a simplified form, is currently present in the **DCF - DocFinance connector** app.

The functions of the two apps do not present conflicts; however, the **EBN – Billing Note** app is not integrated with DocFinance.

Therefore, in the case of using DocFinance, the bills entered via the **EBN – Billing Note** app will not be managed by DocFinance and, in fact, it will not be possible to pay them.

In this case, therefore, the *“Notula RA”* functionality of the **DCF - DocFinance connector** app must be used.
