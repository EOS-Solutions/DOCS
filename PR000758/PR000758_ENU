The **professional billing note** is the document that professionals use to certify the work completed and to prove **receipt of the relevant payment**.
In fact, according to the rules regarding VAT (article 6 of Dpr 633/1972), **the fee should be issued upon payment of the amount requested by the beneficiary of the service.**
However, the possibility of issuing this tax document even before payment of the benefit remains valid.

In a broad sense, the billing note can also be seen as an advance payment that is paid to suppliers even when they are not subject to withholding.

Currently, those who want to manage billing notes use a DocFinance feature.

However, this functionality is very limited as it is linked to the supplier card (there is no easily consultable list) and only manages suppliers with withholding tax.

With the new APP it will be possible to manage notes for all types of suppliers, including foreign ones (therefore without withholding tax) and possibly also in foreign currency.

The two functions will not conflict even if the use of only one of the two managements is recommended
