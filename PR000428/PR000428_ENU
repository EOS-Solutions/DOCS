With the aim of **using the configurator also from external tools**, the "**external configuration**" was created, which allows to use the configurator "**via code**" through a configuration ID. In this way it is possible to open a configuration, perform the insertion of characteristics obtaining interactive information on the other "connected" characteristics, on prices, etc. etc., and then possibly complete the configuration by creating items, production BOMs, routings, etc. etc.

The tool is in use by some installations where it has been used for integration with web pages.

**The integration with a possible website must be developed as a custom.**
