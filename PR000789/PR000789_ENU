Through the «Account mapping setup (OBN)» page, it is possible to set up the G/L counterpart accounts to be assigned to bank transactions, based on the attributes associated with them.

In fact, it is possible to associate a counterpart (G/L account, Bank Account, Customer, Supplier) to each combination of attributes, which will be used automatically in the recording of the accounting transaction.

The counterpart can be generic or specific for each current account and will be proposed by the «Automatically connect (EOS)» function in the Payment reconciliation recording form.

For each setup line, it is possible to define the «Document type» that will be used in the accounting recording (the options provided are «Default» and «Blank).

The «Default» option enables the standard behavior of BC that provides only the «Payment» or «Refund» document type depending on the sign of the transaction.

For the detection of financial charges/income, transfers and, in general, movements that are not collections or payments, it is therefore possible to use the «blank» document type.
