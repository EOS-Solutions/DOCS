Others important setup are WIP Method and WIP Posting Method:

The method encoding allows you to specify the timing for recognizing costs and revenues, giving you the flexibility to manage the two pieces of information differently.

**IMPORTANT:the app only supports the 2 methods circled in orange: ‘JOB COMPLETED’ and ‘PERCCOMPL’.**

*Note: The last column distinguishes between system-defined methods and those that can be custom-defined. Obviously, the rows with this flag are not modifiable.*


This is a standard setup, for more information:
