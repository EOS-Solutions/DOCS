The “EMA Budget Allocation” App, certified for Microsoft Dynamics BC, extends the Analytical Accounting functions that can be implemented through the “EMA – Extended Management Accounting” App.

It therefore allows you to:
* manage allocations and determine the rates of production CDCs, based on budget data (loaded into the Budget C/A);
* calculate a preventive C/E of Profitability Analysis.

The analytical accounting and profitability analysis procedures to be performed are the same as those explained in the online help section relating to the EMA App; the fields and functions integrated with the installation of the EMA Budget Allocation application are clarified below.

EMA Budget Allocation therefore depends on the use of the EMA App.
