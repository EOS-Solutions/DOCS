* **SEPA Direct Debit Exp. Format (1)**: set the correct export code.
* **Creditor No. (2)**: this field must contain the “**Creditor Identifier Code**”.
The Creditor Identifier Code is a unique code that allows the creditor to be identified in the SEPA area. It is important because it is uniquely associated with the SEPA mandate number. It is mandatory information.
* **Direct Debit Msg. Nos. (3)**: enter the No. Series to be assigned to the name of the SDD file that will be created.


A value must be entered in the “Transfer” tab of the Bank Account card in the “CUC” field.
The CUC code ("Codice Univoco CBI") is mandatory.
It is an 8-character alphanumeric code that is assigned by the banking system.
