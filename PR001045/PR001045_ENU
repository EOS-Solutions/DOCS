For the purpose of issuing a sales, return, or cancellation receipt, it is necessary to define a mapping between the POS VAT codes in LS Central and the fiscal departments configured in the setup of the Epson fiscal printer.
The setup is unique across the entire system and is not dependent on the store or POS terminal; therefore, it is mandatory to configure all fiscal printers with the same VAT departments.

In the setup of the “POS VAT Codes”, all the parameters that can be configured directly in the fiscal printer department setup have been added.
The only mandatory field is the “Fiscal ID” field, where the VAT department number corresponding to the LS Central VAT code must be entered.

Therefore, in the “Fiscal ID” field, enter the number of the corresponding department as defined in the fiscal printer setup.
