Formulas can be used in both **rule relations** as well as **BOMs** and **routings**.
It's possible to use mathematical operators and brackets keeping in mind that square brackets indicate the values that characteristics assume during configuration.
Supported mathematical operators are: +-*/ ^ e and the constant PI.

For example, formulas can be inserted directly into relations in the Transfer Value Formula field:

In the event that a formula is recurring, or in any case used in several places, it can be created and then recalled (eg in production BOM).

In the TAG section you can enter the characteristics (or other formulas) to be used in the formula.

On the Formula lines, there is a field **Enable formula rounding**, which can be activated for Formula type lines. By default, a formula inserted into another formula is not rounded (rounding only occurs at the end). By activating the flag, you can change this behavior.

The formula must be expressed using the values assigned in the TAGs.
By using the conditions enabler, you can insert different formulas based on conditions.
