Formulas can be used in both **rule relations** as well as **BOMs** and **routings**.
It's possible to use mathematical operators and brackets keeping in mind that square brackets indicate the values that characteristics assume during configuration.
Supported mathematical operators are: +-*/ ^ e and the constant PI.

For example, formulas can be inserted directly into relations in the Transfer Value Formula field:

In the event that a formula is recurring, or in any case used in several places, it can be created and then recalled (eg in production BOM).

In the TAG section you can enter the characteristics to be used in the formula.
The formula must be expressed using the values assigned in the TAGs.
By using the conditions enabler, you can insert different formulas based on conditions.
