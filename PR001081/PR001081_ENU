The app provides support for the use of a Fiscal Printer (Registratore Telematico), in order to issue and store commercial sales or service documents, as required by the Italian Revenue Agency.

After a sales transaction is registered at the POS, the system issues the commercial sales document via the fiscal printer.
In addition, the app also allows printing of all management (non-fiscal) documents, as provided by LS Central standard.
## Additional Printing Operations
The app allows printing of management documents or executing specific functions related to document printing on the fiscal printer.
The functions related to registered transactions that involve issuing commercial or management documents are usually available within the transaction list at the POS.
