The Extended Combine Shipment (ECS) app is used as a substitute for the standard Business Central function "Cumulative Invoicing" and allows you to:

•	Define "invoicing methods" to specify the grouping criteria of documents based on the customer.
•	Set invoicing frequency to determine the shipping recovery period.
•	Speed up the process of generating preliminary sales invoices.
•	Schedule the invoicing process.
•	Subject the invoicing process to Data Security Workflow.
•	Assign a specific document class to invoices generated automatically by ECS.
