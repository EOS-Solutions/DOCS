**Higher level relations** are used when:

-   The child item has characteristics that are not present in the parent item (otherwise the transfer of values would happen automatically)
-   Characteristic mappings are required (interaction between characteristics must occur between parent and child)

NOTE: Higher level relations occur only between configurable items (type: neutral to configuration).

You can condition the configuration of a child item based on the configuration choices of the parent item.

-   The parent item must be a CONFIGURABLE item  
    The child item must be a CONFIGURABLE item

The values that the child item inherits from the parent item must be set in the configuration rules.

-   The **value transfer from the higher level**, transfers the value of the characteristic from the higher levels (going up the BOM tree) to the child article;
-   The **calculation from higher level** can involve characteristic formulas configured in higher levels.
