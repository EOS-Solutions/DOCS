Rules define the **maximum set of characteristics** to link to each «neutral» configurable item. They **contain all the «instructions»** that the system needs to take into consideration during configuration.

For each rule it’s possible to define:

-   The **list** and **sequence** of characteristics that should be prompted to the operator;
-   The **list of values** that the characteristic can have for that rule;
-   A **codification algorithm** for the item **code** and **description**;
-   The **business logic** among the characteristics as defined by the «Relations» table:
    -   Mandatory or optional characteristics;
    -   Automatic filling of secondary characteristics depending from an input characteristic;
    -   The compatibility of values for a characteristic according to other chosen values.

These are the main fields present in the rules:

| **Field**                    | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Code |Rule code.|
| Description |Rule description.|
| Status |The allowed values are: **Open** and **Released**. A rule in **Open** status: It is editable. The items that use it are not configurable. The configurator returns the error: Status must be equal to Released in Rules: Code=XXXX. Current value is Open. A rule in **Released** status: The rule and the linked tables are not editable: characteristics, relations, etc. The items that use it are configurable.|
| Master |Indicates that the characteristics and their values of a rule can be used by other linked rules. The connection is made through the connection field in the rule characteristics.| 
| Enabled Format Code |It is used to enable the formatting of item/variant codes created by the configurator using a formula defined in the Format Code field. If not enabled, the items/variants are created with the No. series in the Configurator Setup.| 
| Format Code |Defines the formula by which the item/variant code generated by the configurator is calculated. You can enter free characters or use characteristic values. Characteristic code in curly brackets {} to use the value description. Characteristic code in square brackets [] to use the value. You can also use [ITEMNO%] to enter the neutral item code.|
| Code Counter |It is used in case you want to add a counter to the end of the code.|
| Digit Counter |Identifies the number of digits to be used for the Code Counter.|
| Use Item Description |Enables using the neutral item description (it’s added before the description constructed according to the format description).|
| Format Description |Defines the formula used to calculate the description of the item/variant generated by the configurator. You can enter free characters or use characteristic values. Characteristic code in curly brackets {} to use the value description. Characteristic code in square brackets [] to use the value. You can also use [ITEMNO%] to enter the neutral item code.|   
| Format Description 2 |Defines the formula used to calculate the description 2 of the item/variant generated by the configurator. You can enter free characters or use characteristic values. Characteristic code in curly brackets {} to use the value description. Characteristic code in square brackets [] to use the value. You can also use [ITEMNO%] to enter the neutral item code.|   
| Use Excel |The configurator provides the possibility of associating the rule with an Excel sheet for the management of relations. By using this field, you can decide when the formulas expected in the Excel sheet are executed. The allowed values are: **Blank** which corresponds to never, **During process**, **Configurator closing**.|
| Has Content Excel |Active if a relationship spreadsheet has been associated with the rule.|
| Trigger Custom Code |Triggers custom code during the validation of the characteristic values. The custom code can be executed during the process or after the configurator closes. Please contact your partner for information on how to extend the configurator logic.|
| Use Neutral Routing |The configurator for all items with this rule does not generate a configured routing but uses the same routing as the neutral item.|
| Configuration Type |Specifies how the Configurator works (Items or Variants). The Default Type uses the configuration on Setup.|
