A configuration table called Scanner Setup is provided, which allows you to define the various methods of managing the "barcodes" to be requested from the operator during the activity declaration phase. The types are Linear, Sequential, Positional, Different Separators, Custom.

Linear allows you to select the elements that make up the single barcode in addition to the separator character. For example, by selecting Item ID, Tracking, and Quantity with separator character | The Power App will accept barcodes of this format ITEM001|LOT001|10.

Sequential allows you to define what information should be requested from the operator and in what order. In the specific example, the operator will be asked for 3 barcodes: the first contains the item identifier, the second the traceability code and the third the quantity.

One of the components of the barcode is the Item ID field. By Item ID we mean not only the item code but the set of its references:

Positional which provides for a single barcode and the elements are identified by defining their sequence and maximum length.

Different Separator similar to linear but with the ability to define different types of identifiers/separators and their position (e.g. it can be used for ENA128). N.B. Replace Instance is used to indicate whether it should break at the first or last occurrence of the separator found in the string.

Custom managed via custom in Business Central.
Sample source code available on EOS Sample.
You must extend enum **EOS089 WMS Barcode Type** and implement interface **EOS089 WMS Custom Barcode Int.**

In the **Barcode Part** field, you can also manage up to 10 **Free Text** type fields. For each of the fields, you can also manage the name and value of the label. The fields can be managed via code by hooking up to the appropriate events.
