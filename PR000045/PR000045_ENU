The Custom Defined Fields app allows you to enter over 30 customizable fields in different cards, without involving a programmer and without a development license (Business Central OnPremise version).

It's possible to: 
- activate the custom fields in a few seconds using the different types of data managed: dates, numbers, codes, etc.
- link the fields to a table for data validation
- select any existing table (e.g. Articles categories or Country codes ...) or define a new list of completely customized values / descriptions
- automatically propagate the values of the custom fields of customers and vendors on sales and purchase documents, inheriting the activated options

To make the fields visible on the pages you can enable them from the appropriate setup by setting some simple options.

**NB:** Field names can be customized and can be translated into multiple languages.

The custom fields are avaliable for:
- Customer
- Vendor
- Item
- Sales header
- Purchase header
- Resource
- Job
- Employee
- Fixed asset
- Transfer header
- Service header
