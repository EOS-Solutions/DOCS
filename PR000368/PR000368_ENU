Depending on the intra section you want to fill in, you need to select the "Type" of declaration (Sales or Purchases and both will include the related adjustments), the year and the period of interest; We will also have to select the «Declaration Type» choosing between:

- Complete
- Statistic
- Fiscal

They are not controlled and are not exported

Once the header has been compiled, the lines can be inserted using the "Suggest lines" function

During the extraction phase we can indicate a cost adjustment percentage which will affect the statistical value. This calculation is to be used as an alternative to adjusting the costs of the Intrastat Shipping Code table and the cost breakdown of the Item Charge.

The declaration lines are retrieved from the posted document lines: Purchase invoices, Purchase credit memos, Sales invoices, Sales credit memos, Service invoices, Service credit memos

The proposed lines can then be modified manually and possibly excluded from the declaration using the appropriate flag.

If the “Intra-community processing” flag is active, it identifies the processing performed and received within the community, i.e. the invoices relating to external processing carried out between EU countries.

It is also possible to manually insert the lines using the appropriate function.
