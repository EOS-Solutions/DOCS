#### Setup Procedure
**Control Management**:
   - Access the "App Runtime Check (EAL)" page.
   - Compatible APPs will appear in the setup page list where the control can be enabled.
   - Select the desired APP.
   - Enable (or disable) the control for the specific APP using the "Enable Runtime Check" and "Disable Runtime Check" actions.
   - The first time the control is activated, all external calls of the APP will be blocked in test environments. To activate the control but unblock calls in this environment, click "Unlock".
   - Whenever an environment (or company) is cloned, it is possible to manually unblock calls for that specific test environment/company using the "Unblock" action.
