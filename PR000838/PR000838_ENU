* **Draft** 
* **Definitive print**
* **Reprint**

To generate the report, click on Actions – Print Questionnaire Report from the questionnaire summary screen. Alternatively, from the Questionnaire List page, click on Related – Print Questionnaire Report.

**Print Choice**: you can choose to print it as a draft (even if the questionnaire is not 100% complete), a final print (only if the questionnaire is 100% complete), or a reprint (after final printing)

**Print Template**: if this option is checked, the report will show the template responses (the provided answers will not be displayed, only the possible answers).

**Print Front Page**: if this option is checked, the report will include a cover page showing information related to the questionnaire (company logo or graphic, code and version, draft/final/reprint option, date, time, user).

### Final print and questionnaire closure
Once the final print is done, the questionnaire is automatically considered "closed"; therefore, it will no longer be possible to modify the answers. You can only perform the final print when the questionnaire completion percentage is 100%. The "closed" status can be viewed by clicking on the version number in the Questionnaire List (EED).
