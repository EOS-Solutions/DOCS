In the product configurator setup there is a field called **ÃEnable Item TranslationsÄ** that allows to save the language configured description in items / variants. The description is composed with the rules already provided by the configurator and uses the language descriptions present in the characteristics and their values.

For each characteristic and relative values itÂs possible to handle the translation:

-   In order to **translate the characteristic description**, leave the field ®Characteristic Value¯ empty;
-   to **translate the caracteristic value description**, leave the field ®Characteristic Value¯ empty.

During configuration, descriptions are generated for all languages in the neutral item.

**You can also print document with characteristics translations without save item translations.**

This translation is handled in document prints, but only if the app Advanced Document Reporting (ADR) and the related bridge app with the product configurator are installed.

The information regarding the chosen **characteristics** for the configured item can be handled in **document prints** with a flag in the **ADR app**.

ItÂs also possible to choose whether to print the characteristic code, description, or both.
