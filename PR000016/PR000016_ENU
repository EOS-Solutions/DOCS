The Customer Vendor Compensation App for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central allows you to select lines from two lists of accounting items to compensate. For example, if you select select a Customer invoice which total is 100 ± and a Vendor invoice which total is 80 ±, it will be suggested the entry to connect the two accounting items: the Vendor invoice will be 0 ± and the Customer invoice will now be open for 20 ±. Precondition: Customers and Vendors can be connected by different options:
