The Customer Vendor Compensation app enables simple and efficient management of offsetting between open customer and vendor items.
This functionality allows users to easily select the due items to be offset, choosing them from two lists of open items displayed on a summary page, or to automatically generate the proposed offset entries.
It is also possible to perform a bulk compensation procedure.
The customer/vendor link can be established through either the customer/vendor master data record or the contact.
For example, by selecting a customer invoice for Eur 100 and a vendor invoice for Eur 80, the system will suggest the accounting entry to link the two items, fully clearing the vendor invoice and leaving the customer invoice open with a remaining balance of Eur 20.
