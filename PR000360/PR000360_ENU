The statistical value should be calculated by adding the delivery costs from the place of departure to the Italian border; if this is not possible, using the cost adjustment %, these costs are estimated based on the value of the goods and the percentage indicated. 
In the case of returns, the costs must be deducted by ticking the relevant column.
