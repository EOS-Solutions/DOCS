The possibility of creating a **Billing note** from a provisional purchase invoice has been foreseen.
This functionality can be used in the case of a vendor who is also a salesperso, for whom a proforma invoice has been created.

This feature is not visible in the menu, but can be viewed by Personalizing the page:

In addition to creating a new **Billing Note**, it will be possible to view and subsequently manage/modify the created document.
The reference to the **Billing Note** No. will also be present in the header of the purchase invoice.
