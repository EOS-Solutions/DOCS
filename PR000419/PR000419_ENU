Discounts can also be applied to the price list

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000419-0/Detailed Document Discounts - Usage_Price List_ENU_001.png"><br>

From the three dots of the Detailed Discount field you can access the detailed discounts table. In this case, the Process-> Update preview action will not be present as we are in the price list and there is no starting amount on which to apply the discount.

By inserting item 1250 in a purchase / sale document, the system will automatically propose the discount inserted in the price list.
