Once the contribution entries have been posted, they can be extracted in a list that groups them by type and reference period. The bill is preparatory to the generation of the Grandi Ditte file, for this reason it deals with FIRR or Enasarco type entries.

With the "Suggest contributions entries" function it is possible to populate the bill lines by analyzing the contributions entries corresponding to the filters entered. In Contributions Bill List (CMS) we find all the lists already created. Opening a Card:

From **Suggest contributions entries** the system generates the lines of the bill: it proposes the contributions entries for each vendor and salesperson. The fields in the lines are useful for generating the Grandi Ditte file (for companies with a number of salespeople>100). In fact, in the Grandi Ditte file will be necessary to export the Relationship Code field and the Total Document Amount given by the sum of the Document Amount (LCY) fields in the lines.

After releasing the bill, you can generate and subsequently send the large company file from **Create File**. The **File **Tab contains the details.

| **N.B.** |
