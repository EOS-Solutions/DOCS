Once all transactions in the reconciliation page have been linked, it is possible to proceed with posting.

* It is possible to post the statement only if all the movements have been "linked"

* For each bank transaction, the system carries out a double-entry posting with the recognized account as a counterpart and assigning a specific Document No. defined in the "Posted Reconc. Ledger Entry Nos." field of the bank account. (Unlike the standard functionality that assigns the same document number to the entire statement even if the transactions have different dates).

* If the movement is combined with an already accounted bank movement, the system does not carry out further transactions, but "links" the movement.

* It is possible to manage the "Document type" according to the CBI reasons.

On bank accountancy movements:
* the Value Date is visible (1):
* each movement reports the number of the statement from which it originated (2):
* the single transaction is always referenced in the "External document number" (3).

It is always possible to trace all the information of the bank transaction from the bank account ledger entries or from the G/L entries. This allows the reconciliation and matching of entries in the case of use of transitory accounts for the recognition of receipts and / or payments
