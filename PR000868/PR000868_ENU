To configure package feeds directly in VS Code, you can go - from the Gordon icon - to the "Package Feeds" entry.

Click the **+** icon on the "Package Feeds" item to create a new feed.

This will create a new package feed and open it in the editor. The configuration is essentially a `.json` file. The following properties are common to all feeds:

- **$schema**: This is the schema of the JSON file. Do not modify this. It is provided to allow intellisense in VS Code to work.
- **Name**: Gives a unique name to the feed.
- **Description**: Gives a description to the feed.
- **Enabled** [Obsolete]: This exists for backwards compatibility only and can be ignored.
- **ProviderName**: specifies the provider to be used for this feed.
- **ProviderType** [Obsolete]: This exists for backwards compatibility only and can be ignored.
- **Configuration**: the configuration for this package feeds. This objects depends on which package provider you choose. The schema is availble in **$schema** and VS Code will give you a hand in discovering the possible values and how to define them.
