# DocSolutions Table Setup (DCS)

In DocSolutions (DCS) Table Setup, the default setups must be loaded from Actions-\> Load Default:

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000113-0/EX069.03_LoadDefaults.png"><br>
<br><br>
The system offers us the defaults to load, choose "DocSolution for Sharepoint". Then he proposes the tenant, the client and the secret again.

Confirm by pressing "Next". Finally, we must indicate the Sharepoint site to which to associate the DCS app and the specific Library (in the image: "Eos Labs" and "Documents"). By clicking on Default import settings, the setup is complete.

**Libraries Setup**

From Edit, open the Document Library(s) you wish to enable, e.g. "Customer":

the system automatically enables the display of the Factbox relating to DCS on the Lists.

From Libraries we choose a default library and from Open library we set its setup:

In the Tab "Storage" we choose the Sharepoint Site and the Document Library to which to connect it.

At the bottom of the page we set the attributes to be displayed on the Business Central pages:
