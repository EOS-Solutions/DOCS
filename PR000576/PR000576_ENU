The Block Customer function checks whether the dimensions, set as mandatory, have been correctly entered on the Customer Card.

The "Value Posting" field allows you to set the checks based on the following options:

* Code Mandatory
* Same Code: is the same as the "Dimension Value Code"
* No Code

The same function is also used for vendors and items.
