<table><td>The deferred invoice must be issued and recorded by the 15th day of the month following the month in which the goods are shipped/delivered or the services are actually performed. It will still be necessary to indicate the reference month for the service, in fact legally the transaction will be part of the periodic settlement of the reference month and the VAT must be paid by the 16th of the following month. Example: if the payment for a given service was made in May, even if the invoice is issued in deferred mode on June 15, the transaction will fall under the periodic settlement of May and the VAT will have to be paid by June 16. Precisely because of the existence of the latter obligation, which makes subsequent tax management complicated, it is now standard practice to invoice by the end of the month (typically on the last business day) and not defer in the following 15 days.</td></table>
