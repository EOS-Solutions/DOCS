### Master G/L Accounts

Since the hierarchy between the companies could also be horizontal (the companies are all operational, there is no real "source" company) it can be useful to have a limited control for the Chart of Accounts and Dimensions.

This control is exercised in Master G/L Accounts (MDI).

From Actions->Import G/L accounts you can import the chart of accounts of the main Company. Thanks to Companies Accounts Matrix you can link, for each account, the main company to the remote companies.

You can select multiple records and associate them massively with one or more companies by using Manage->Batch Selection.

### Master Dimensions

The same thing is possible with Dimensions. On the page MDI Master Dimensions from Actions->Import Dimensions, you can import them and decide which ones to replicate to different companies.

On the Companies/Dimensions Matrix page it is possible then to assign dimensions to each company.
