**Notes**
The import function for bank transactions has some limitations.
* Transactions are not filtered by the bank reason for collection type, so all transactions in the reporting file are imported, not just, therefore, collections.
* Transactions are not filtered by bank account, so if there are transactions from multiple bank accounts in the file, they will all be imported to the balance bank account specified on the request page.
* The account number is not valued. Transactions are imported with account type “Customer”, but the Account No. field will not be valorized.


**Record type CBI**
