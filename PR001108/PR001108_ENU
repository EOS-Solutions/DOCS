Below are the recommended steps in **Business Central**:

1. **Verify Dataverse integration**  
   - Open the standard **BC↔Dataverse** integration setup and ensure the map includes the **folder path field** coming from CE (exposed as **CE SP Folder Path** or equivalent).  
   - If needed, **force an initial sync** to populate BC records.

2. **DocSolution – SharePoint Setup**  
   - In **DocSolution SharePoint Setup**, enter **Tenant ID**, **Client ID** and **Client Secret** (same values used in CE).  
   - Test the connection; proceed only when **valid**.

3. **Define Library (Storage “CE”)**  
   - Create a new **DocSolution Library** and set **Storage = CE**.  
   - Set **Site** and **Library Name** exactly as in CE.  
   - **Folder Pattern**: enable the flag that **prefixes the mandatory “CE Folder Path”** (auto‑inserted) and complete any additional structure.  
   - **Filename Pattern**: configure how files are resolved/looked up.

4. **Bind to table**  
   - On the **Table** (e.g., *Customers*), bind the newly created **CE** DocSolution Library.  
   - Keep the *CE Folder Path* field **hidden** for end users (default) or expose it for diagnostics only.

5. **Operational check**  
   - Open a synchronized **Customer** and verify in the **DocSolution FactBox** that CE files (e.g., *Customer agreement*) are available.  
   - **Open/download/upload** to validate permissions and path resolution.

- Keeping **Site** and **Library** aligned across CE and BC is essential to target the correct folder.  
- With **Storage = CE**, the **CE Folder Path** is the **root** of the pattern in BC; do not remove or reorder it.
