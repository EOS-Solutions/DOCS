From the page titled "**Invoicing Sessions (ECS)**", you can verify:

* The **session ID** of the Invoicing session, which also identifies the documents generated during the entire billing session.
* The **date** and **time** when the session was scheduled, as well as the start and end date and time for completed sessions.
* The **user ID** who scheduled the billing session.
* You can also check the status of the billing session, which can be:
**Scheduled**: The session has been scheduled and will be executed at the next scheduled queue run.
**In Progress**: The session is currently being executed.
**Completed**: The billing session has been completed.
* It also provides a count of any errors (marked in red) that may have occurred within the billing session.

In addition to the information mentioned in the previous slide, from the "**Invoicing Sessions (ECS)**" page, you can also:

* Open the **Dashboard** of the Invoicing session's execution log when its status is "**In Progress**" or "**Completed**".
* Delete a "**Scheduled**" session.

The **Dashboard** (Invoicing log) allows you to view, with varying levels of detail depending on the setup, the progress of billing in terms of billed customers, generated documents, and any *Warnings* or *Errors* during billing.

From the **Dashboard** (Invoicing log), you can also "**View the source**" of the highlighted log entry (e.g., Customer or Invoice) and, in case of errors, view the "**last error stack code**" as well.
