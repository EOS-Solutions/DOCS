| Alternative Sales / Purchase G/L Code | If the Purchase / Sales Line Type is set as <ins>Charge (Item)</ins>, the calculation engine often needs to handle special rounding operations for very small amounts when calculating charges. If necessary, you can then add a line for the small amount that remains, using the alternative purchase or sales account. |
