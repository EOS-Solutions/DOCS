With the posting, the bill is issued and stored in the archive **«Issued Invoice Discounting and Factoring Bills»**.

The posting of the invoice discounting bill will make the following general ledger entries:

**Bank C\C Discount @ Invoice Discount**

The customer ledger is not valued and the discount invoices, therefore, are not paid.
