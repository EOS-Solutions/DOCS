It is possible to perform a mass settlement of customer/vendor ledger entries.
The procedure can be executed either from the journal or via the dedicated task.

This function allows you to select, through the parameters to be set, the customers/vendors and/or the ledger entries to be settled.<br>
The procedure will propose the balancing entries in the batch specified in the setup.

The settlement method used is the “**balance**” method, meaning the system proposes the settlement entries related to the source customer/vendor ledger entries and then posts a single balancing entry in the opposite section, but without linking it to the specific ledger entries.
Settlement is executed only if the final balance of the recipient account does not become negative as a result of the process.


**Note**<br>
* Posting Date: if the posting date is not specified, the work date is used.
* Document No.: the document number is used only if no temporary number series is defined in the batch setup.
* Currency Code: the currency code acts as a filter and only one currency can be specified. If the field is left blank, only ledger entries in the system currency (blank), generally EUR, will be processed.
