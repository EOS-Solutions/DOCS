Items involved in the BOM can be a pricing tool.

To manage them, the functionality in the Configurator Setup must be enabled through the **Create BOM Lines in Sales Document** flag.

The prices of the generated lines can be calculated using the **Price Calc. Method** option:

-   **Price List**: The price is derived from the sales prices.
-   **Percentage BOM Line:** The price of the individual components is calculated using a percentage in the production BOM lines.

The **Change to Comment Line** field, if enabled, "transforms" the line with the neutral item from which the configuration was launched into a comment.

In the production BOM lines, you can define **which components should generate a line in sales documents**.

It is also possible to define the percentage with which to calculate the sales price (percentage of the configured item price excluding surcharges).

In a sales document, the configurator generates the additional rows taken **from the first level of the production BOM**.

Any neutral items are configured and any associated surcharges / optionals are generated.
