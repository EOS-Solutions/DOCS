On the Item Card there is the field Secondary Unit of Measure Code that specifies the second unit of measure for the item considered. It is not mandatory to enter a value. If the field is not filled in, the second unit of measurement will not be handled.

Once the article has been moved, it will no longer be possible to change the unit of measure (both basic and secondary).

In Item Units of Measure we can see all the units of measurement set for the product. For example:

On the Item Card you need to enter the **Secondary Unit of Measure Code** and its **Secondary Quantity Calculation Method**.


For Secondary Qty. Calc. Method the allowed values are:

-   **Default:** It allows the insertion of both units of measure, but performs the calculation only if the other quantity is equal to zero.
-   **Fixed:** Always converts between quantities.
-   **No Default:** No conversion between quantities.

For Quantity Calc. Method the allowed values are:

-   **Quantity per Unit of Measure:** For the calculation between the primary and secondary units of measurement, the system uses the standard Quantity field per unit of measurement (Division).
-   **Reverse Quantity per Unit Of Measure:** For the calculation between the primary and secondary units of measurement, the system uses the field Reverse Quantity per Unit Of Measure (Multiplication).

N.B. The Reverse Quantity is used only for internal calculations between primary and secondary units of measure
