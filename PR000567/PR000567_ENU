**Apply Contributions Ledger Entries (CMS)**

If the flag ÃAutomatically Apply Contribution Vendor Ledger Entries on Posting Ä is not active in the Commission Setup, you must manually proceed with connecting the supplier accounting entries.

It is therefore necessary to link afterwords the entries mentioned above. The connection can be applied manually in standard mode starting from the vendor entries.

To facilitate this operation, the Enasarco FIRR and FISC app provides a specific page: Apply Contributions Ledger Entries (CMS).

In the example, the system suggests on the right which entry should be connected to the selected one. The entry is suggested according to the posting date and the document number.
