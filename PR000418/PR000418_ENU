In addition to the standard "Line Discount %" field, the lines include the "Detailed Line Discount" field where multiple discounts can be entered. From Lines-> Related Information-> Detailed Discounts or by clicking the three dots:

you can access the "Detailed Discounts" table in which you can view the discounts entered. It is also possible to add more discount lines:

the system has splitted the discounts entered in the document line by creating three detail lines. The last two lines were added manually.

|In the detailed discounts table you can specify the discount Type . In the document lines the discount entered is always as a percentage.|
