It is therefore an alternative to the standard BC invoicing methods, in order to create a dedicated billing plan based on the project contractual agreements. Here are the main features of the IPL app:

*   Define the parameters of the invoicing plan as agreed with the customer and vendor

*   Track invoices and project progress

*   Post advance invoices with automatic split for VAT structure

*   Invoices can be created using percentage or absolute amounts or both

*   The invoice plan can be rapidly adapted to eventual changes in the sales order amount

*   Create the closing invoice at Project end with automatic reversal of advance lines previously generated. Recalculate any advances when the quantities and values in the sales order are changed
