**Bank transactions are acquired and processed in full by electronic flow**.

All reporting entries must be processed and, in general, manual entries must not be entered (with the exception of the posting of customer bills - SDD \ Riba, dishonored entries, vendor bills).

**The bank transactions in Business Central** will be the exact **copy of the bank transactions**.
Any reversals \ adjustments on bank transactions will still be accounted for.
