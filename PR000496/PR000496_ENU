Once posted the entries are reported on page Commissions Entry (CMS):

These entries entered manually will add up to the entries automatically calculated by the system.

**Commission entry posting from sales invoice**

On the sales documents (order and invoice) header the system inherits the customer salespersons and then performs the calculation of the commission:

On the header, the system displays the salespersons linked to the document:
