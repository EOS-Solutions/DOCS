Last synchronization logs towards a slave company have all status 'Waiting remote"; what to do?

Probably an error in job queues of the master or slave company  occurred, so we suggest to execute the following steps, in this order:

1. restart job queues in both companies

2. check that synchronization profiles are enabled in the master company and that in MDI setup the flag "Disable all synchronization" is disabled in both companies.

3. check if the MaxBackgroundTask limit has been exceeded

4. delete the log in waiting status ( both on the master company and on the slave one).
