The Eos Solutions Transport Costs (ETC) app allows you to calculate the transport costs incurred for the shipment / receipt of goods from BC's documents (sales orders, sales shipments, purchase orders, purchase receipts,ÿ transfer shipments, etc.). It also allows you to monitor and monitor how much will be charged for transport costs by shippers.

ÿIt is possible to use the costs calculated in the management accounting ([EMA Extended Management Accounting (EMA) EX023]({{<relref "ema-extended-management-accounting">}})).

Starting from a price list provided by the shipper, it is possible toÿ**trace a transport cost foreseen for a specific shipment**ÿ(price list by weight, number of parcels, number of pallets, etc.). This cost can then beÿ**compared with the carrier's invoice**. ÿ
