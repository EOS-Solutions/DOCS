It also allows you to monitor and monitor how much will be charged for transport costs by shippers.

 It is possible to use the costs calculated in the management accounting ([EMA Extended Management Accounting (EMA) EX023]({{<relref "ema-extended-management-accounting">}})).

Starting from a price list provided by the shipper, it is possible to **trace a transport cost foreseen for a specific shipment** (price list by weight, number of parcels, number of pallets, etc.). This cost can then be **compared with the carrier's invoice**.

In addition to the EX038.01 Transport Costs for Simulated GL entries app, it is necessary to install the Accruals and Simulated General Ledger App.
