With the Environment Groups, you can logically group different BC Services. 
This feature let you install and check apps in multiple services at once.

The groups have only two fields: Name and Description

To add a service (or a docker container) to a certain group, there is a dedicated action in Docker Container list and Server's Services list.

By clicking the action "Install Apps" in the Environment group Page, you will be redirected to an App Manager page.

In this list, after selecting one or multiple feed, the list of apps will be loaded. 
The apps will have one of these status: 

| **Status**         | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Installed          | The app is installed and up-to-date                                             |
| Update Available   | The app can be updated to a newer version                                       |
| Consolidate        | The app is not aligned across all the services. It may be installed in one service but not in another, or they have different versions. |
| Not Installed      | The app is not present in all services                                          |


From this page, you may install/update the apps from the selected feed.
