Furthermore, by carrying out the VAT settlement with the "Post" flag, the amount of the entered VAT pro rata is accounted for in Debit, using the account set up in the VMI setup:

In the procedure for calculating the periodic VAT settlement (LIPE), which can be carried out using the Electronic VAT Settlement for Italy (EVS) App , the amount of the pro rata VAT is deducted from line VP5.
