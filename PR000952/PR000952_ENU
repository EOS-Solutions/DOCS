**Is there a default secondary unit of measure? ?**
No, for each item the item unit of measure and the quantity per unit of measure must be defined and then set as the secondary unit of measure.

**If I enable the second unit of measure in a company, is it mandatory to specify it for all items ?**

No, enabling the second unit of measure is necessary to make the fields visible to manage the second unit of measure.
The secondary quantity will be tracked only for items that have the **Secondary Unit of Measure Code** field compiled.
To make the compilation of this field mandatory for certain types of items, you can install the app [EX003 Data Security]({{<relref "data-security">}}).

**Where do I define the rounding precision to use ?**
The app uses the **Rounding Type** and **Rounding Precision** defined for the unit of measure (BC standard).
[Dual Unit Of Measure - Setup]({{<relref "dual-unit-of-measure-setup">}})

The **Quantity Rounding Precision** value in the item units of measure is not used by the app and it is recommended not to set it.

**Using the Default calculation method, what happens if the primary quantity is used (e.g. shipped) completely but the secondary quantity is not ?**
When a positive movement is no longer open, the secondary residual quantity is automatically reset to zero.

<br>

**Using the Default calculation method, what happens if the secondary quantity is used (e.g. shipped) completely but the primary quantity is not ?**
The residual quantity check follows the standard BC logic, so only the residual quantity expressed in the main unit of measure is checked.
There is no block if you declare a secondary quantity to be shipped/consumed that is greater than the residual secondary quantity, as long as there are open movements with sufficient residual (main) quantity to record the negative movement.
