Integration with Excel is used to calculate characteristic values through an Excel file that is uploaded and used as a template.

It is very important to evaluate performance according to the complexity of the spreadsheet.

**Using Excel works only on the first level of configuration**. Excel files associated with the layer rules underlying the first layer are not used.

You cannot use Excel sheets that contain macros.

Excel integration use Microsoft Excel Online and Microsoft Sharepoint Online; this is available for both On Premise and SaaS Business Central environments.

To manage the values of some characteristics through Excel it is necessary to define within the characteristics associated with the rule:

-   The characteristics involved in Excel Calculation (Process in Excel)  
-   The characteristics for which the value will be read by Excel formulas (Get output from Excel)

The rule must also specify **when the Excel file is used**, which can be:

-   **During process**: The calculation of the output characteristics is triggered by the validation of each input characteristic. It's a more performance-impacting mode for setup time;
-   **Configurator closing**: The calculation of the output characteristics is triggered when the configuration is confirmed.
