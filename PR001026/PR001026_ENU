### 5.0  Setup
The basic settings for creating SEPA Credit Transfers payments are as follows.


#### 5.1 Bank Export/import Setup
A new export format code will need to be created in the Bank export/import setup.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_01.png"><br>

* Processing Codeunit ID: **1220** - "SEPA CT-Export Fil"e.
* Processign XMLport ID: **18123333 - "SEPA CT pain.001.001.09 CBI v00.04.01"**.
* Check Export Codeunit: **1223** - "SEPA CT-Check Line".

**Notes “Check Export Codeunit”**<br>
Regarding the “Check Export Codeunit” to be set, it should be noted that codeunit 12178 of the Italian localization is present in the system. However, this object appears to be updated with a long delay.
It is suggested, therefore, for the control when exporting the file to use codeunit 1223, as it is updated regularly.


#### 5.2 Bank Account Card setup
In the “Transfer” tab of the bank account card the following parameters should be set.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_02.png"><br>

* **Payment Export Format (1)**: set the export format created.
* **IBAN (2)**: IBAN code is mandatory.


In the “General” tab of the bank account card, the parameter should be set: **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.**.
Here the Serial No. to be assigned to the name of the SCT file that will be created should be indicated.

**CUC Field**<br>
According to CBI standards, the CUC code (CBI Unique Code) is mandatory.
It is an 8-character alphanumeric code that is assigned by the banking system.
However, this data element is not always required by the bank, and to ensure continuity with previous versions, a specific check has not been implemented.

Therefore, it is suggested that the “CUC” field on the bank account card be valorized in order not to risk the discarding of the provision.

#### 5.3 Company Information Setup
The VAT number of the company is a mandatory data element in the XML file of transfers.
The “VAT Registration No.” field on the “Company Information” tab must be mandatorily filled in.


#### 5.4 Entering Vendor Transfer Bill
To enter a transfer bill for vendor payments, select the menu item "Vendor Bill Card".<br>
From the Vendor Bill Card page, you can access the list of draft vendor transfer bills.
Here, you can view all payment instructions that have been entered but not yet posted.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_B01_Menu.png"><br>

To create a new transfer bill, click the "New" action. In the document, the following fields must be filled in:
* **"Bank Account No." (1)**: The bank account used to make the payment.
* **"Payment Method Code" (2)**: the payment method associated with the documents to be included in the payment proposal.
* **"Beneficiary Type" (3)**: the beneficiary type (Vendor, G/L Account, Bank Account).

Posting Date and List Date are automatically suggested based on the current work date.

**Beneficiary Type**<br>
The "Beneficiary Type" field allows you to specify the type of account to be posted as the counterpart.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_B03_Distinta_tipo_beneficiario.png"><br>

The available options are as follows.

| **Field**                                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Vendor**                                | This is the default setting. It enables the payment of vendor invoices or the manual creation of vendor payments. The dispositions result in a posting to the vendor subledger.                                                                                                                                              |
|**G/L Account**                            | This option allows you to execute a bank transfer by posting the amount directly to a general ledger account.                                     |
| **Bank Account**                          | This option enables you to execute a bank transfer to a different bank account belonging to the company.                                        |

**Note**<br> It is not possible to include dispositions with different "Beneficiary Type" values in the same payment proposal.

**Entering Dispositions**<br>
When the "Beneficiary Type" is set to G/L Account or Bank Account, dispositions must be added exclusively via the "Insert Vend. Bill Line Manual" function.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_B04_Distinta_pagamenti_manuali.png"><br>

**Beneficiary Information**<br>
The "Create Manual Bill Vendor Line" page includes a newly added "Beneficiary" section, which enables the entry of beneficiary information necessary for processing the payment instruction.

**Vendor Transfer Bill of type "G/L Account"**<br>
In payment proposals of type "Bank Account", the beneficiary's information must be manually entered by the user.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_B05_Distinta_conto_coge.png"><br>

**Vendor Transfer Bill of type "Bank Account"**<br>
In payment proposals of type "Bank Account", beneficiary details such as name and postal address are retrieved from Company Information, whereas IBAN and SWIFT codes are sourced from the selected bank record.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_B06_Distinta_conto_banca.png"><br>

**Note:** Transfers of type "Conto C/G" and "C/C bancario" cannot be combined.

#### 5.5 Creation of the SCT file (SEPA Credit Transfers)
**Vendor Bill List Sent Card**<br>
To export the SCT file from the Vendor Bill List Sent Card, select the “Export Bill List to File” action.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_05.png"><br>


#### 5.6 Credit Transfer Cumulative Debit
It is possible to define how the bank should report the payments of the bill list on the periodic statement.

The credit transfer cumulative debit reporting request covers the entire bill list and with it, in practice, you are asking the bank to report, on the statement, a single transaction for the total of the bill and not the individual payment.

This mode of reporting is consistent with that used in Business Central in the bank entry, which creates a debit line on the bank account for the total of the bill.

The reporting mode should not be confused with the “cumulative transfers” option, which allows a single transfer to be arranged to pay multiple invoices for the same supplier.


**Credit Transfer Cumulative Debit - Bank Account Card**<br>
Credit transfer cumulative debit is selectable, on the bank account, via the “Credit Transfer Cumulative Debit” field in the “General” tab.


<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_Addcum_07.png"><br>

**Credit Transfer Cumulative Debit - Vendor Bill List Card**<br>
All payments, issued on a given bank, will automatically carry the bank's “Cumulative Bill Debit” setting.
The information is not editable in the Vendor Bill List and Vendor Bill List Sent Card.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR001026-0/EN_SCT_Addcum_08.png"><br>


***Tag "BtchBookg"***<br>
The information, in the XML file, is carried via the tag “BtchBookg”.
If “BtchBookg” is true the cumulative bill charge is requested.

<br>*Example*<br>

#### 5.7 Payments to Third Parties (Beneficiary Different from Supplier)
In cases where a supplier has transferred its receivables to a third party, such as a factoring company, it is possible to manage payments correctly by specifying an alternative beneficiary in the vendor’s bank account card.

This functionality allows the payment to be directed to the third party (e.g., the factoring company), while maintaining the correct accounting entry on the supplier’s ledger.

A dedicated "Transferee" section has been added to the vendor bank account card, enabling the entry of beneficiary details different from the supplier for invoice payments.

To activate this functionality, simply fill in the relevant fields for the alternative beneficiary (name, address, IBAN, etc.). These details will then be used in the payment proposals.

This ensures that the payment is executed in favor of the transferee, while the accounting remains correctly posted to the original supplier.
