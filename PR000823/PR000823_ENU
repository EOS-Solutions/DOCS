The warehouse pick feature has been implemented with the possibility of scanning with the "Pick & Pack" mode which allows the items to be placed on a handling unit at the same time as the items are picked which will then be assigned to the warehouse shipment associated with the pick. The Pick & Pack activity must be activated in the appropriate setup:

After activation in the power app, inside the pick, the new section called P&P appears where the user can add or create new handling units in Draft status. In this example, 2 handling units have been created, and the second one is the one in use.

When pick lines are posted, the items are loaded into the selected handling unit.

The handling unit in Draft status is assigned to the warehouse shipment which is ready to be posted.
