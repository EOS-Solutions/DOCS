In the documents, the possibility of activating the feature called Pick & Pack has been provided. The feature created for Picking, where it allows at the same time as the picking of the items to put them on a handling unit that will then be assigned to the linked warehouse shipment, has also been extended to other documents. The documents in which it can be activated are: Purchase Receipt, Warehouse Receipt, Put-away, Sales Shipment, Warehouse Shipment, Picking, Transfer Shipment, Purchase Return Shipment.

After activation in the power app, inside the pick, the new section called P&P appears where the user can add or create new handling units in Draft status. In this example, 2 handling units have been created, and the second one is the one in use.

When pick lines are posted, the items are loaded into the selected handling unit.

The handling unit in Draft status is assigned to the warehouse shipment which is ready to be posted.
