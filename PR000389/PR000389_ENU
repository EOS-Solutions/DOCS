<br>**CUC Field**<br>
According to CBI standards, the CUC code (CBI Unique Code) is mandatory.
It is an 8-character alphanumeric code that is assigned by the banking system.
However, this data element is not always required by the bank, and to ensure continuity with previous versions, a specific check has not been implemented.

Therefore, it is suggested that the “CUC” field on the bank account card be valorized in order not to risk the discarding of the provision.

In the “General” tab of the bank account card, the parameter should be set: **Credit Transfer Msg. Nos.**.
Here the Serial No. to be assigned to the name of the SCT file that will be created should be indicated.

#### 6.3 BNK Setup
In the BNK Setup, the "Currency Code Field No." allows you to specify which field in the Currencies table should be used to provide the ISO code of the payment currency.
