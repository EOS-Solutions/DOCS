If "Create Purchase Invoice" on Commission reason Codes (CMS) is true the system will create directly purchase documents instead of using settlement prospects.

The commission entries created by sales documents have no reason code, and never will be extracted by this report, but they must be generated through the procedure of the settlement prospects.

Otherwise you can perform the procedure by making a specific commission reason code in order to create an invoice for each commission reason code.

On the page Commission Entry the % cashed is calculated when connecting customer ledger entries, the report populates the field Payable (LCY):
