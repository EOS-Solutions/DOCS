In the Conai setup there is a field, called **Enable advanced weights management**, which allows to enable the CONAI calculation separately by primary and/or secondary weight.
there is also a field, called **VAT Bus. Posting Group Private Customers**, that allows to perform a filter on the VAT business posting group categories to identify private customers and exclude the CONAI chargeback on the invoice.

The purpose of the two fields is to respond to the requests of some of our customers, packaging manufacturers.
In order to comply with the various Conai declarations, it is now possible to manage the following cases.
**Sales Italy**
* Primary packaging: chargeback on the invoice and optional generation of CONAI entries.
* Secondary packaging: no chargeback on the invoice and optional generation of CONAI entries.
* Private customers. Possibility to exclude the chargeback on the invoice, but with generation of CONAI entries.

**International Sales**
* No chargebacks on the invoice. Generation of CONAI entries for both primary and secondary weights.

In addition to the fields in the CONAI setup, the following fields have been added in the CONAI Purchase/Sale Setup:
