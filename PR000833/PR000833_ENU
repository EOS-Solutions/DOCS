Materiality analysis is not required, but disclosures B3-B12 are to be provided when they are applicable to the undertaking’s specific circumstances. 
* **Narrative – PAT Module (Policies, Actions and Targets)**: This module defines narrative disclosures (N1 – N5) in relation to Policies, Actions and Targets (PAT), which are to be reported in addition to disclosures B1-B12 if the undertaking has them in place. This module is suggested to undertakings that have formalised and implemented the PAT.

Once all fields are completed and the module combination is set, click "+New" at the top to create the questionnaire based on the latest available template version.
