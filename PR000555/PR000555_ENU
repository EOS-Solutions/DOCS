The Packing List is a set of handling units, connected to order lines, and has a tree structure.

First, you must select the handling units from "New Handling Unit".

Clicking on New Handling Unit the system will open the list of packaging materials:

For example, we choose a box and then add content from **Add Content** .

The page shows item lines based on orders/shipments. We enter quantities for the items to be added and press OK.
