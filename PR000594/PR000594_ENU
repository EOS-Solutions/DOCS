Clusters are structures composed of a header and rows. 

Clusters have a filter detail that, once certified, will generate the detail of the base entities of this cluster. 

It is possible to include or exclude codes using the "Include" and "Exclude" filter types. In the example below, Cluster CLU0000001 is composed of customers from central code COOP excluding a specific customer or field from the master data.

After certification, it is possible to view the explosion of customers through the "Customer Cluster Detail Subscreen" functionality.
