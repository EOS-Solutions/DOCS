| Correction Mode           | Å **Correct Existing Entries**: the pre-existing movements are modified and new ledger entries are generated according to the new deadlines. <br>Å **Reversal Movements**: the system closes entries and reopens new ones. A transfer is made with the closing of the original entry (which is settled with a payment type movement) and the opening of new occurrences on the accounting entries is performed. |
| Renegotiation Description | Free description for the accounting entry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Criteria for reminder level   | Å **Block posting**: it is not possible to renegotiate an accounting entry of a customer present in an issued reminder. <br>Å **Reset last issued reminder level**: it is possible to renegotiate a customer accounting entry even if already present in an issued reminder; the new customer accounting entries generated, in the field "Last issued reminder level", will show the value 0 (zero). <br>Å **Keep same last issued reminder level**: it is possible to renegotiate a customer accounting entry even if already present in an issued reminder; the new customer accounting entries that will be generated, in the field "Last issued reminder level", will show the reminder level of the original entry (subject to renegotiation).  |
