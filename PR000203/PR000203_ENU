# **Obliged entities**

On the basis of current legislation (Article 221 of Legislative Decree 152/2006), the manufacturing and user companies are responsible for the correct and effective environmental management of the packaging and packaging waste generated by the consumption of their products and for this they participate in the National Packaging Consortium.

Manufacturers: the producers and importers of raw materials for packaging, manufacturers and importers of semi-transformers intended for packaging, empty packaging manufacturers, importers, dealers of empty packaging.

Users: the purchasers-fillers of empty packaging, the importers of "full packaging" (ie of packaged goods), the self-producers (who produce / repair packaging to pack their own goods), the merchants of full packaging (buyers- retailers of packaged goods), merchants of empty packaging (who buy in Italy and resell this packaging without carrying out any transformation).

By joining CONAI, the manifacturer / user is required to pay the CAC (Conai Environmental Contribution), differentiated by type of packaging placed on the market.
