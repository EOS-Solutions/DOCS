This feature only intervenes when the "Extended Combine Shipment" app is used, and the grouping criterion is set to "Discount Set ID".

**Feature Enabled**

When the feature is enabled, grouping is done based on the order's "Discount Set ID", grouping orders with the same "Discount Set ID".

**Feature Disabled**

If disabled, the behavior is as follows:

- If the detailed discount includes discounts that are not percentages (e.g., discount amount, discount amount per unit, or discount amount per net weight), a unique ID is generated for each shipment line, leading to an invoice for each shipped line.
- Otherwise, the order's "Discount Set ID" is used.

{{% alert title="NOTE" color="warning" %}}
When non-percentage discounts are present (e.g., discount amount, discount amount per unit, or discount amount per net weight), the discount set ID is not "reused" across documents.

Therefore, even if identical values are present, two documents with the same amount-based discounts will have different discount set IDs.
