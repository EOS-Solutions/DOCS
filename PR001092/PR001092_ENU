In Manufacturing Setup there is the flag "Enable BOM Lines Dates Management" that activates the use of validity dates on BOM lines.

Validity dates for old and new component can be chosen from "Calculate Components" report request page and these dates are used for populating all created worksheet lines. 
Then they can be manually modified on worksheet.

When lines are run, only for "New" action messages, processing fills old and new BOM components with relative validity dates taken from worksheet.
