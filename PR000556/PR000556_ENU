After checking the user can enter values in the field **Last Actual Value** on the inspection order's lines.

If the entered value is outside the range maximum / minimum value set in setup, the system asks whether to create a Non-Compliance.

The same goes for the parameters "attributes." In this case the Non-Compliance is created if the user enters a negative value in the Findings field.

The Non-Compliance shows (Tab "Reference") all data related to the original document which generated the inspection order and then the Non-Compliance. From Lines we can manage Causes and Corrective actions

if another parameter is out of the correct range and requires the creation of a Non-Compliance, in the Non-Compliance already generated the system will add a line.

The field Global Action on the General tab allows to manage the Non-Compliance with the DataSecurity app if installed.

The Inspection Order status will be modified:
