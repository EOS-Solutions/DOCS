It is important to underline that:

* The explosion of Production BOM and the routing is provided even if the configurator is managed by variants.
* The price is calculated using the matrix prices in the same way as for sales documents, taking the customer from the project header.
* No surcharge lines are generated, but the line price will include the surcharge amounts.
* Optional lines or lines for the Production BOM are not generated.
* If the "Set the item price from configuration" field in the product configurator setup is enabled, the price calculated by the configurator is stored in the item.
