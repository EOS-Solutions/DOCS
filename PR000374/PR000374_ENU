**Note on lines relating to Services**

In the case of Purchase type lines, the value of the payment country is taken from the "Pay to - Vendor No." field. of the header of the purchase document or, possibly, by the supplier's bank; in the case of Sales type lines, however, this value is proposed based on the value of the "Country Code" field on the "Company Information" page.

**Call of stock**

The ÃSuggest linesÄ function has been integrated to propose, in the new section, the lines relating to registered transfer shipments, with the following characteristics:

- Country code of departure ÃITÄ (Country code present in the Company information table) and Country code of destination EU (Intrastat code field of the Countries table). If the Reference No. field is filled out in the transfer shipment, this will retrieve the VAT number to be displayed in position 32 of the layout.
- EU country code of departure (Intrastat code field of the Countries table) and country code of destination ÃITÄ (present country code of the Company information table).

The lines of the declaration can however be filled in and/or modified manually, on the user side.
