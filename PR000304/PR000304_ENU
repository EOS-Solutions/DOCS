| Electronic Invoicing Starting Date                     | Date starting from which the user will send invoices in electronic format. The minimum requirements for passing the Exchange System (SdI) checks must therefore be respected. When posting a document, if the Posting Date of the document is later than the electronic invoicing starting date set, the system checks that the following fields are filled out: - Electronic Document format - Payment Method Code - Payment Terms Code - Electronic Document Recipient Code or customer Email PEC -VAT Registration No. or customer Fiscal Code  If one or more checks fail, the system will block the registration and return an error. |
| Country Code Field No.                                 | Choose the Country Code Field No., which will indicate to the system the correct ISO code to be considered for electronic invoicing. The check procedure on the registration date will only verify the documents for which the invoicing customer's country code is “IT”. In this way it is possible to exclude foreign countries (for which it is not mandatory to issue an electronic invoice) from system checks on the fields: Electronic document format, Payment Method Code, Payment Terms Code, Electronic Document Recipient Code/ Customer Email PEC , VAT Registration No. / customer Fiscal Code                               |

**Other setups**

From **Job Queue Entries** is possible to schedule the sending of .xml files. Indicate the codeunit or report to be executed, specify the starting / ending date and time and define the days if necessary.

From **Customer Setup** you can define a specific setup group for all customers and / or define a different setup group for a single customer

This setup can be reached in the "Outbound setup FTE" through the "Setup groups" and "Customer setup" actions.

In the "Setup groups" it is possible to set up multiple models with different rules for exporting the data to the electronic invoice/credit note in xml format.

These settings concern the inclusion or exclusion of the PDF attachment of the invoice/credit note, the export of transport document data, other related data, etc.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000304-0/48ElectronicInvoiceForItaly.png"><br>

In the "customer setup" it is possible to combine the setup previously set to all customers, to a single customer or to a single [document class](https://helpbc.eos-solutions.it/main.aspx?lang=en&content=ClassiDocumento.html)

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000304-0/48ElectronicInvoiceForItaly.png"><br>

From **Transliteration List** it is possible to evaluate symbols / characters in the .xml files so that the system recognizes them. (Transliterating = Transcribing a word, a sentence, a text from one alphabetical system to another)

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000304-0/32ElectronicInvoiceForItaly.png"><br>

In **VAT Posting Setup** fill in the field "VAT Transaction Nature".

In addition to the setting “Duty Stamp Setup (FTE)", in ordet to export the values 2.1.1.6 \<DatiBollo\>, 2.1.1.6.1 \<BolloVirtuale\> and 2.1.1.6.2 \<ImportoBollo\> to the Fattura Elettronica 2.1.1.6 layout tag it is necessary to enable "Duty stamp" for the related VATposting setup:

**Communication methods**

| **PEC Email**                        | If the Customer has only the PEC email, we will populate the field "email PEC" in the customer card and insert as Electronic Document Recipient Code: "0000000". The created .xml file will contain this email address. The sdi then recognizes the Customer in accordance with the email address. In case the Recipient code has not been entered on the customer card. the system will populate the code automatically with "0000000" |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Recipient Code**                     | if the Customer has provided us with a recipient code, we will enter this code in the field "Electronic Document Recipient Code" in the customer card (customer's code or intermediary's code). If no recipient code has been specified, the system will not allow the export of the .xml file.                                                                                                                                         |
| **VAT Registration No. / Fiscal Code** | If we are not aware of any of the previously mentioned data, then in the field Electronic Document Recipient Code we enter '0000000'. The Exchange System will recognize the Customer based on the VAT number or Fiscal Code defined in the .xml file.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Foreign Electronic Invoices**        | In case of invoice issued to non-resident subjects, not established, not identified in Italy, and sent to the Exchange System in order to transmit the data for the Invoice Data declaration, we set 'XXXXXXX' in the Electronic Document Recipient Code. Obviously the SdI will not deliver the invoice, therefore it is required to send it also with standard methods (eg email with attached .pdf).                                 |
