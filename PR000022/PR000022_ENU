The CONAI app from Eos Solutions allows compliance with regulations regarding the recovery of steel, aluminum, cardboard, wood, plastic, glass packaging.

CONAI, the National Packaging Consortium (<http://www.conai.org/>), is a private non-profit consortium. It is a system forming the response from private companies to a problem of collective interest, i.e. the environment, in accordance with the guidelines and objectives set by the political system.

800,000 companies which produce or use packaging have joined the Consortium System.

CONAI collaborates with Municipalities according to specific agreements governed by the ANCI-CONAI National Framework Agreement and serves as a guarantee to citizens that any materials from separate waste collections are fully used through proper recovery and recycling processes. Any companies that join the Consortium pay a compulsory Contribution which serves as a form of financing allowing CONAI to support separate waste collection and packaging waste recycling.
