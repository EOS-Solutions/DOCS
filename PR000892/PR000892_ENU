Similar to factoring, also for the advance invoice, it is necessary to enable the use of the bank account by setting the **«Advance Bank»** field.

In the **«Advance Invoice»** section of the Bank account tab, you can specify the following information:

* **«Advance type»**: defines whether to use a G/L account or a bank account for accounting entries.
* **«Adv. Inv. G/L Account / Bank Account No.»**: defines the G/L account number or the bank account to use in the entries.
* **«Advance %»**: allows you to set the agreed advance percentage.
* **«Postpone Due Date»**: allows you to recalculate the due date by adding a pre-established period.

### Bill posting group

For the management of invoice advances, <u>no specific bill posting group should be entered</u> for the bank account used.
