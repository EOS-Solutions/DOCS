The **Dual Unit of Measure** app has the ability to calculate physical inventory for Package No., as well as lot and serial. To implement the new feature, a report called **70624432 EOS051 Calc Inv SerialLotPack** has been created. The previous report, **70624430 EOS051 Calculate Inv SerialLot**, has been set to obsolete pending (**it will be permanently deleted in BC30**). The activation of the new report must be done via Feature Flags (EAL):

After the Feature Flag (EAL) is enabled, you can use the new report to calculate the physical inventory. **Any customizations made in the previous calculation report must be redone in the new one. The new report can also be used by those who do not manage the Package No.**.
