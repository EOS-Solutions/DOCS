### Setup
If you wish to use the SEPA format based on ISO 20022 specifications instead of the SEPA-CBI format, a different setup must be configured.

This is because the rules defined by CBI (Corporate Banking Interbancario) are not mandatory for all banks operating in Italy.
Some foreign banks operating in Italy use the SEPA format based on ISO 20022 specifications as an alternative to the SEPA-CBI format.

Additionally, there may be cases where SEPA payment instructions need to be sent directly to foreign banks that are part of the SEPA network.
