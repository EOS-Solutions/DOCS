In SharePoint Site setup (DCS) you need to connect Dynamics 365 CE with SharePoint using an AppRegistration.

Information required are:

| **Field**                 | **Description**                                                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application (client) ID   | The Azure application client ID.                                                     |
| Client Secret             | Azure application Client Secret.                                                     |
| Tenant Id                 | The Azure tenant ID to which connect the client (where SharePoint Site is present)   |

### Pre-requisites:

- Configure SharePoint Site Integration – refer to [Benefits of document management with SharePoint integration - Power Platform | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/set-up-sharepoint-integration)
- Create an App Registration and configure it as documented in DocSolutions for Sharepoint (BC)
- Setup user must have **System Administrator** + **DocSolutions Admin** roles assigned
- Application user must have **DocSolutions User** Role assigned.

### Important for error comunication:

DocSolutions will notify errors creating Sharepoint folders or license messages with in-app notification; **this feature must be enabled in all the apps where the messages must be shown**.  
From Power App portal: open the app (all apps used by customer with DocSolutions use), click on settings, select Features tab and **enable In-app notifications** flag

### Setup and Sharepoint Site Configuration
 
1. Open DocSolutions App and go to SharePoint Sites 
2. Open the Site where DocSolutions must be configured (can be more than one)
3. Open DocSolutions tab and configure the following fields: 
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Tenant ID

  
Once the record is saved the client secret will be encypted and SharePoint Site ID will be populated.  
Message Status indicates the connection test result; if an error message is shown, please correct the configuration accordingly.  
  
**Note**: a valid license of DocSolutions for SharePoint must be activated for the customer based on tenant ID.
