The "Allocation Card" allows the reversal of indirect costs charged to account/dimensions, to other account/dimension combinations (eg: to Work Centers, Divisions, etc.). As with the allocation of actual data, it is possible to use static and / or dynamic allocations.

On the "Allocations List" and "Allocation Card" pages there is the "Allocation Source" field, containing the following options: 

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Final balance (default value) | Allows the allocation of cost accounting entries |
| Budget | Allows the allocation of budget data present in the "C/A Budgets (EMA)" |

The different allocation cards are performed in ascending order of level; with the same level, execution takes place according to the "Sequence" field or, alternatively (if the sequence value is equal to zero), according to the Code field (alphanumeric order).
