You define a Planning Setup either for the planning calculation or for the split of the planning result. In both cases you must define a specific Worksheet. In the picture you can see an example for a setup to do a planning calculation:

* The calculation result is written into the worksheet defined by **Worksheet Template Name** and **Journal Batch Name**

* **MPS** and **MRP** are calculated

* The starting date is calculated by the **Starting Date Formula**, in this example it¡s always Monday of the current week The ending date is calculated by the **Ending Date Formula**

* If you would consider an item filter for the calculation, then you could do this by the Assist button of the **Item Filter** field on the **Action Message** register

On the Planning Setup Card you can set the same parameters as on the planning calculation batch (planning worksheet).
