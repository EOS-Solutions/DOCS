The details of the transport costs for the different types of documents are visible and the total cost is shown below.

Costs can be changed manually.

In the event that the DHL sends us an invoice with an amount higher than that calculated by the system, we enter this amount in the " Invoice amount " field and choose in the " Spread Type " field how to spread the difference on the costs already calculated. Finally we press Apply spread :

When the lines are definitive, after selecting the lines of interest, from "Set Status to Definitive" the costs are blocked.
