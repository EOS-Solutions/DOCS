**Can I extract the physical inventory on a certain date using the Calculate inventory for Serial/Lot No. function?**

The app does not provide for the extraction of the phys. inventory at a certain date.
The inventory calculated by the system must represent the current snapshot of the warehouse stock, which I then eventually correct based on deviations between the physical quantity and the calculated quantity. Calculating the balance at a certain date exposes me to the risk of correcting a quantity that at the workdate would already be aligned with the physical stock.
