The EOS Function API is a tool that can be used in OnPremise installations that allows you to bypass the limitation of Universal Code (the impossibility of using .Net).

Once installed on the server, the EOS Function API will expose several APIs that can be consumed directly and conveniently from Business Central.

The Available APIs are:
* Generation of Barcodes and QR Codes
* Reading and writing of Files and Folders
* Decoding of P7M files
* Manipulation of PDFs
* Connection to Databases

All these APIs are configurable and made secure through an authentication based on API-Key.
