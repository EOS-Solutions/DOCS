In the lines of the shipping price we define the detail of Transport Costs

*   for each service offered by the shipper (e.g. standard delivery, 24-hour delivery, etc.)
*   according to the departure and arrival areas

Let's see an example of a shipping price for shipping areas .

From Related -> Price-> Areas definition we have defined the departure and arrival points:

We have codified each route agreed with the shipper. As seen in theÿ[Setup]({{<relref "transport-cost-etc-ex038setup">}})ÿ, it is possible to use the different filters including the customer filter if we have specific agreements with one or more customers.

For each of the filters you can also define a composite filter, eg. "from postcode 37010 to postcode 37170".

The white warehouse and the blue warehouse are the starting points of the goods from the company (From Location Code Area).

Let's see the lines of the list:
