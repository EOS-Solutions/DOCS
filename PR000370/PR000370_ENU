The logics of use and management of the C/A analysis scenarios are the same as those described in the EMA App.

The installation of EMA Budget Allocation includes the following two fields on the Analysis Scenario page and C/A Analysis Card page:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Allocation Source | <ul><li>Final balance (default value) allows the allocation of the cost accounting entries</li><li>Budget allows the allocation of budget data present in the "Budget C/A".</li></ul> |
| Budget Filter | you can enter this field, if the previous field has the Budget option, to indicate the budget period from which to retrieve the data to be allocated.|

In the case of using the "Allocation Sequence", it will be possible to insert only allocation cards that have the same value as the "Allocation Source" field.

On the C/A Analysis Card, using the "Update Driver Archive" and then "Update C/A Analysis" functions, it is possible to execute all the allocations that have been entered in the allocation list or only those selected through the " Allocation Sequence Äand then calculate the budget rate of the production cost center.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Update Driver Archive | Updates the performance movements of the drivers encoded on the system |
| Update C/A Analysis | Executes the allocation cards in "Certified" status, in order of Level and Sequence/Code |

**Verify data generated through the allocation process**

It is possible to open the Chart of C/A directly from the C/A Analysis Card via Related-> Analysis-> Chart of C/A: the latter will already be filtered for the C/A analysis that we have just performed. Alternatively, you can access the " Chart of cost accounts (EMA)" page and apply the appropriate filters:

Through drilldown on the Analysis Budget Net Change" column, it is possible to access the transactions detail, which can also be analyzed through the "Source Traceability" action.

Should a new execution of the same analysis be necessary, it is possible to carry out the appropriate procedures again. In advance you need to reset data generated by the previous allocation.
