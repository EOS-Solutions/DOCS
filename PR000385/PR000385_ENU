Parameters to be entered:

| **Option**                   |  **Description**                                |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
|Template Name            | Select the journal to use. |
|Batch Name               | Select the batch to use.   |
|Transitory Account No.   | If using a transitory account, it can be selected. |
|Used as posting date       | Define the proposed posting date for accounting entries. <br>Payment Date: proposed posting date will be the due date of the RiBa (pos. 23–28, record 14).<br>Creation Date: posting date will be the creation date in the unpaid file (pos. 14–19, record IB).|


**Notes**<br>
The bank account must match the ABI, CAB, and account number in the unpaid file. If payments are credited to a different account than the one used for submission, a specific bank account must be created.

**Procedure**
1. The RiBa file is created in Business Central from "Customer Bill Card".
1. Upon maturity, wait for the bank to process the results (usually 1–5 days), then download the unpaid file from Remote Banking.
1. **Import the unpaid file into Business Central using the “Import Customer Dishonored (CBI)” function and post the accounting entries.**
1. Run the “Closing Bank Receipts” procedure to apply the invoice with the payment entry.

Closing must occur after posting the unpaid bills, as the unpaid import assumes the related entry is still open. If few unpaid bills exist, you can close them at maturity and manually reopen them before importing.
