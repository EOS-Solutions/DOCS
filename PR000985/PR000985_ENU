Specifies how to recording WIP: 
* *For the project:* total WIP costs and sales value are used to calculate WIP. 
* *For project accounting entries:* accumulated values of WIP costs and sales are used to calculate WIP. 

On the WBS rows, it is necessary to insert 2 informations:
* The first is entered in the header as "WIP Method," which is automatically pre-filled but can be adjusted as needed. 
* The second is managed by the "Total WIP" selector.

Total WIP can assume the following values: 
* *Total:* To calculate all cost or revenue rows. 
* *Exclude:* To exclude the row from the WIP calculation.
