We need to enter:

- **Starting / Ending Date**: posting date range of entries to be settled
- **Settlement Type**:
  - **From setup**: bonus are settled on the G/L accounts or item charge indicated in setup.
  - **G/L Account / Item Charge**: you must enter the G/L account number or item charge code in the "Settlement No." field
- **Settle Temporary Entries**: original movements in the liquidation plan, temporary entries represent "provisional" bonuses, usually dependent on additional conditions.
- **Group by Document**: defines the logic of combining bonus entries, the maximum detail is the value
The settlement populates its journal and the "Amount on Settl. Entries (LCY)" field and consequently of contracts, generating provisional settlement documents (sales credit memos or purchase invoices).

The **journal** (Customer Bonus Matching (SPB)) is the **tool for checking accrued bonuses**, from here you can post the temporary documents generated by the settlement procedure (Settle Temporary Entries). 

 It is also possible to manually match an accrued bonus resulting from a bonus calculated on the basis of documents outside the system or documents wrongly posted without any connection with the respective bonus entries.

**Modify amounts**

From the journal you can change the amount of the bonuses, the change automatically updates the temporary settlement document. Deleting a bonus line deletes the reference document.
