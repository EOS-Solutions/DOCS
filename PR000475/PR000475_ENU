**Commissions**

The App Commissions (CMS) is used to manage and calculate sales commissions for salespeople. The basic flow includes:

-   Define setups for each salesperson. At this stage you can define the basic contractual conditions for each agent (prepayment, settlement period, etc.).
-   Define salesperson roles and sales networks
-   Set the commission calculation method
-   Generate commission entries either manually or through sales documents
-   Ability to manage prepayments or commission cost allocation
-   Commissions settlement directly through the purchase invoices, or from settlement prospects
