**Free Gifts with VAT recourse**

We create a sales order with a line type "Item".

For the item we choose **Recourse as Free Gift Type**:

Releasing the system creates a second reverse line with equal quantity and amount, but of opposite sign and different VAT Prod. Posting Group:

The order total is the VAT, which will be paid by the customer.

**Recap**

If you select a Free Gift Type with recourse the VAT Product Posting Group will be different from the source item line, because the line must show the VAT amount

**Free Gifts without VAT recourse**

We create a sales order with a line type "Item".

For the item we choose **Without recourse as Free Gift Type** and with item charge:

Releasing the system will create a second reverse line with equal quatity and amount, but with opposite sign. The VAT Product Posting Group is the same.

The document total is zero.

**Recap**

If you select a Free Gift Type without recourse the VAT Product Posting Group will be equal to the source item line, because the total must be zero.

**Invoicing**

After posting the shipments related to the two created orders, we generate the invoice. We open a NEW document and from Line-\> Functions-\> Get shipment lines we choose the shipments:

For each shipment the amounts and quantities must be zero:

-   The VAT is zero for the first shipment.
-   In the second the amount of VAT is equal to 1600 euro, which is the invoice total.

**NB.**
The operation is the same also posting the Invoice directly from the Order or by using the cumulative invoicing.
