The Dual Unit of Measure for Italy app extends the Dual Unit of Measure by allowing the management of quantities in secondary units of measure in both subcontracting orders and in the related transfer orders. For subcontracting orders, the use of standard subcontracting price lists is envisaged, appropriately adapted to management in the second unit of measure.
**Please note** WIP items are not managed.
