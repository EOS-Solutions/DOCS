In Quality Rating Purchase (PQA) the system shows all receipts in test. On the basis of this table it is carried out quality inspection associated with the vendor.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Quantity | It is the quantity of the receipt |
| Quantity (Decl.) | It is the quantity specified on the purchase order lines |
| Expected/Planned Receipt Date | It is taken from the order line from which results the receipt; in order to calculate the delay / advance, the system calculates the difference between the expected receipt date and the receipt posting date. |
| Decl. Terms of Delivery | Specifies whether in this evaluation report will be taken into account delivery dates, not just the quantity. |

From Update Rating Code the system will fill in the Quality Rating Code. Let's see how:

* If the system finds a record for an open Inspection Order and there are no Non-Compliance linked to that order, assigns the **highest rating** in the field Quality Rating Code.

* If the system finds a record for an open Inspection Order and there are Non-Compliance connected, then it will leave the field Quality Rating Code **blank**. It will be the user to compile it manually.

| N.B. |
| --- |
| From Inspection Orders (All) you can view the inspection order and any Non-compliance related to the selected line. In this way the user who need to manually assign an evaluation is made aware of the overall situation. |
