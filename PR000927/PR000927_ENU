The allowed values for the field Status are: **Open** and **Released**.

A rule in **Open** status:
* It is editable.
* The items that use it are not configurable. The configurator returns the error: Status must be equal to Released in Rules: Code=XXXX. Current value is Open. 

A rule in **Released** status:
* The rule and the linked tables are not editable: characteristics, relations, etc.
* The items that use it are configurable.

When a rule is **Released**:
* The product configurator performs the **Certify** operation. The certify operation automatically sets the field values **Exclude From Relations Calc.** and **Exclude From Relations Calc. With Conditions** in the characteristics of the rule. Set the field **Conditions Characteristics Filter** in the rule relations. Plus any custom actions. An event has been set up to avoid automatic certification: OnBeforeCertifyOnReleaseRule.
* The product configurator performs the **Save Default Configuration** if provided by the setup. An event has been arranged to avoid the Save Default Configuration: OnBeforeSetDefaultConfigurationOnReleaseRule.
* The operation **Add Rules** present in the values of the characteristics can also be executed when the rule is released.
* The operations **Align Connection**, **Align Rule/Characteristics**, **Certify**, **Excel** can also be performed when the rule is released.
