<br>***Note***: codes assigned to orders, shipments, receptions are exported:
* in the “Origin” field
* as a suffix to the document number in the “C/G key” field.

**Enable DocCredit**<br>
If DocCredit is enabled, the "Notes" field of the "Receive/Payable Batches" flow will export information about the agent and unpaid invoice (this information regards the customer ledger entries only).

***Agent Code***<br>
The "Notes" field will display the salesperson code. The information will be exposed with the string: "DCA:" + "Salesperson Code".

Note: is exported the salesperson code present on the customer ledger entries (which shows the agent entered in the "Salesperson Code" field of the invoice or credit note document header).

In case you are using the "CMS" (Commission) app, please note that the agent automatically set in the "Salesperson Code" field of the document is the agent having the role defined in Commission Setup - "Primary Salesperson Role".

***Unpaid Payment Type***<br>
If the invoice, with Riba or SDD payment method, is unpaid the string "DCN:" + "Effect No." (where the Effect No. is taken from the "Final Customer Effect No." field present on the line of the Issued Customer Bill) will be exported in the "Notes" field.

**Export order**<br>
The information in the "Notes" field will be displayed in the following order: the information on the unpaid amount will be shown first, then the salesperson code.

**Order and Shipment Due Date Information**<br>
Enabling the "Export Orders" field will export, in the "Receive/Payable Batches" flow, the information  related to sales and purchase return orders/orders.
Export is done according to the following rules.
* Orders in “Released” status that are billable (that do not have a reason code non-billability) are exported for the unpaid quantity and for the quantity yet to be invoiced.
* Due dates are reproportioned based on the number of due dates in the payment terms on the order.
* Due date is calculated based on the date on the **lines** of the document:
    - from the "Shipment Date" for sales orders;
    - from the "Expected Receipt Date" for purchase orders.

* Currency Date is calculated as "Due Date" + "Default Delay Day".
Delay Days are taken from the customer/vendor card and, if not present, from the "Customer/vendor default delay day on proceed" field in Docfinance Setup.

* If the Shipment date/Expected Receipt Date is not present on the document lines, it will be inferred from the corresponding field on the header. If the reference date not even present on the document header, the "Workdate" will be used.

* If the payment condition is not present on the order or the payment terms does not have the setup for calculating due dates, then a "sight" due date ("0G") is assumed.


**Option "Export Detail Shipment/Receipt**<br>
In case "Export Detail Shipment/Receipt" option is enabled, information related to shipments and receipts (including of return documents) will be exported. 
The export criteria are: 
* information for shipments/receipts not yet invoiced are calculated from the ***recording date*** of the document.
* For orders, only the unfulfilled portion is exported (if the option "Export Detail Shipment/Receipt" is not active, however, the unfulfilled portion and the unbilled shipped portion is exported).


**Log Retention**<br>
Through the log retention criteria, it is possible to define the period of time for which the archives of the data exchange with DocFinance are kept.

The archives in question are as follows.
* COGE Batches Archive. 
* MasterData Batches Archive.
* Receive/Payable Batches Archive. 

Data prior to the retention period can, therefore, be deleted.
Deletion is done by job queue, that can be created through the action "Job Queue - Retention Policy".

|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Data Deletion Mode           | ***Complete***: The deletion of all data that meet the defined criteria takes place during the execution of a single job queue run. The deletion is performed in record batches, according to the value specified in the "Deletion Chunk Size" field.<br> ***Partial***: for each job queue execution, only the number of records specified in the Deletion Block Size field will be deleted from each of the three archive tables. This mode uses fewer system resources, but until all archives have been completely deleted, some archives may be only partially removed. Deletion is performed in batches of 1,000 records until the specified "Deletion Chunk Size" is reached. |
| Deletion Chunk Size          | Specifies the number of records to be deleted per execution instance for each of the archive tables. If set to 0, the following default values will be used based on the mode: Complete – 1'000; Partial – 10'000. |
| Import Archive Ret. Period        | Defines the retention period, in days, of the import archive "COGE Batches Archive".                            |
| Export Archive Ret. Period           | Defines the retention period, in days, of the export archive "Master Data Batches Archive" and Receive/Payable Batches Archive".                                               |

<br>
Note: retention period set to value "0" is not considered. For security reasons, if you enable the job queue without setting a period greater than zero, no records will be deleted.

If both fields "Import Archive Ret. Period " and "Export Archive Ret. Period" are not set, the job queue will produce an error, warning that a period must be set for at least one archive type.
