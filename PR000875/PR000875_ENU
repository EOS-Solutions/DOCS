You have two ways to update **Gordon**:

### With the built-in Auto-Update
When the app starts, it will automatically check if an update is available. 
If so the program will ask you to install it or not. 

By choosing "Yes" it will first download the update, then when it will be ready it will ask you to start the upgrade.
After that the program will restart.


### From the EOS Gordon Installer
Same as the installation process
