Within the store master data card, some additional fields have been added to define extra functionalities compared to the standard setup.
## Electronic Invoicing
For the creation and posting of sales invoices and credit memos directly from the POS, it is necessary to define at least two sales document classes that include a default posting setup with posting type “Statistical Document” and item ledger entry generation “Do not create item entries”.
These classes must then be specified in the store master data; it is therefore possible to define different classes, with different number series, for each individual store.

* "POS Data Entry Type": indicates whether the system must manage the issuance of vouchers as ‘single-use vouchers’ or ‘multi-use vouchers’.
* “Def. Tender Type Inc.Exp.”: indicates the payment method that identifies the issuance of a single-use voucher from the POS.
* “Tender Type Deferred Payment”: indicates the payment method that identifies a “deferred” payment. If a customer is assigned deferred payment for a sale, meaning not settled directly at the cash register, the transaction is automatically closed with the default payment method specified in the store master data.
