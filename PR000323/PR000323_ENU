There are cases in which it is necessary to **exit the configuration without confirming it**, only pausing it, just as there are situations in which the person who inserts some characteristics by answering some questions, does not have permissions to create a new code because it is necessary for another user to do it.

To meet these needs you can take advantage of two tools:

**1. Lite configuration  
2\. Save without configuration**

<br>

The lite configuration is a configuration mode that **prevents the indicated users from completing the configuration**. The lite mode can only be used when the configuration starts from sales and purchase documents.

In **User Setup**, you can define which configuration regime the user is subject to in the "**Product configurator mode**" field. The options are

-   **Blank**: the user can create the configured item;**  
    Lite mode**: the user cannot create the configured item and there are no controls on the compiled characteristics;**  
    Lite mode + charac. values mandatory**: the user cannot create the configured item but is obliged to fill in the mandatory characteristics;

<br>

When you exit the configuration in lite mode, the neutral item remains on the source document line and the configuration remains pending.

**SPECIAL CASE**: Activating the **"Enable configuration for lite mode"** flag in user setup gives the lite user the ability to force close the configuration.

<br>

Without being listed as a lite user, it is still possible to pause the configuration of an item using the **"Save without configuring"** option in the configuration batch when the configuration is triggered by sales and purchase documents.  
The configuration is interrupted allowing the user to exit, but the list of characteristics is saved in a special table, giving the possibility to resume the configuration at a later time.
