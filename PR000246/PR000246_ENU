The debit invoice for empties items is created in two different ways depending on the setting in the **Create GL Account Lines on Empties Invoice** field in the Packaging Setup (HUM):
* If active, the invoice is created using the **Empties Invoicing Account No.** present in the packaging material. By using the debit with account the price and discount are still read from the price list of the item associated with the packaging material.  
* If deactivated, the invoice is created using the **Item No.** present in the packaging material.

The invoice creation function also includes the field **Create reverse journal lines**. If active in addition to the creation of the debit invoice, the function also creates the reverse lines in the Container Journal, allowing the balance to be reset. Posting is manual.
