The Combine Warehouse Shipment app in warehouse receipt replaces the standard **Get Source Documents** function, which allows to select the headers of the source documents, with a new function called **Get Source Document Lines** that allows to select the individual lines of the source documents.
Among the various fields displayed on the page there is the editable column **Quantity to Receive**, through which it is possible to type the quantity received during the import of document lines.
This feature allows to speed up the operations of entering Vendor Receipts.
