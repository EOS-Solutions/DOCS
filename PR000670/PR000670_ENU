ICQRF code is the identification code assigned to companies by the "Department of the Central Inspectorate for the protection of quality and the repression of agro-food products fraud".

Each ICQRF code must be associated with an ICQRF credential code which contains the user and password for accessing the SIAN telematic services.

The ICQRF code can be associated with one or more locations. The assignment is mandatory if you want to send the information to SIAN.
