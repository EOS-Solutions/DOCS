| Table ID / Table Name   | Define a table in which you need to set the data security process (it is possible to control both standard and custom tables)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Document Type           | It is possible to choose exactly the document type to put in control (e.g. Sales Header contains: Order,, Quote, Invoice, Credit Memo etc. Each type has an associated value (0, 1, 2, 3 etc.) which allows you to define precisely the document you need).  <img width="" src="https://docs.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000526-0/3DataSecurity(1).png"><br> |
| Description             | It is possible to write a description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Status                  | The system assigns a status to the table in control (New, Under Development, Certified). When the status is "Certified", Data Security app starts checking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Path in Status Change   | It is possible to define alternative paths for the same entity. For example, you can differentiate between Purchase Items and Production Items. By activating the option you will then have to define the various paths (pressing Status Transactions )                                                                                                                                                    |
| Type Field No.          | It is possible to put a specific field in control                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Table Value Type Filter | It is possible to filter by Customer, Customer Price Group, All Customers, Campaign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
