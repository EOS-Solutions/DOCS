Columns details: 

* Customer no. and project no.: the system automatically fills in the columns based on the reference project 

* Responsibility center: travel agreements can be project-specific or specific to each responsibility center 

* Resource no.: travel agreements can be valid for all resources within the project team or can be specific on a resource-by-resource basis 

* Travel type: outward/travel/return 

* Not accumulable on O/R: the system automatically activates the flag on the return lines to prevent the expense from being double counted in the case of a return trip 

* Invoicing type: 



1. On cost
1. Fixed price 
1. Without calc. 
1. Forfait 



* Work type code: it indicates the type of expense. The work types must be coded in the specific table:
