Here you can define the type of inspection to be made and it is possible to manage **multiple versions** of the plan and define a **status**. The status specifies if it is possible to use the plan. The options are:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| New | If the plan is new (first time you create it) |
| Certificate | If the plan is certificate and therefore usable |
| Under Development | If the plan is under development and therefore not yet usable |
| Closed | If the plan is not usable, but accessible as history |

Other fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Expected Value | Indicates the parameter value that is expected as a measurement result with the device in use |
| Maximum Value | Indicates the maximum tolerable value for the defined parameter for the control result to be positive |
| Minimum Value | Indicates the minimum tolerable value for the defined parameter for the control result to be positive |
| Frequency | This field is used if you want to assign a frequency to the row. Options:  <br>0 = The Inspection Plan is always performed  <br>1 = The Inspection Plan is performed on the basis of the specified frequency in the field "Frequency Period"  <br>The Frequency Period is: day, week, month, quarter, year  <br>  <br>  Example: we post a first receipt which constitutes the zero point. Next receipt: if it is posted one week from the previous one (the system compares the receipt registration date with the posted ledger entry), the line on the inspection order is not entered. |
| Frequency Period | Day  <br>Week  <br>Month  <br>Quarter  <br>Year |

The parameter can also be an attribute, in this case it is not necessary to enter these fields.
