The Eos Solutions Inventory Register app (IVP) allows you to print the Inventory Register.

The fiscal requires the inventory register for stock accounts that exceed certain limits of revenues and inventories.

In all other cases, the stock accounts is an optional writing. The stock Journal aims to detect the incoming and outcoming of goods within the warehouse: it is therefore a chronological register in which are recorded, in order of date, all inputs and outputs of goods from the warehouse.

For every entry is reported:

 Å Code and description of the good;

Å Posting and Document Date;

Å Location code;

Å Document number;

Å Description of the operation;

Å Quantity;  

Å Unit of measure.
