Starting from versions **23.0.115, 24.0.69, 25.0.19**, the unique filling of CIG (Fattura Tender Code) and CUP (Fattura Project Code) has been made mandatory.
Therefore, within the same document, it will be possible to specify only one CIG code and one CUP code.

In addition to the standard fields, the control has been extended to the compilation of Related Documents Data.
Any modification/insertion in the Related Document Data, if the standard fields are empty, will also have the effect of updating the standard fields.

The values present in the two standard header fields Fattura Tender Code (CIG) and Fattura Project Code (CUP), when posting the invoice or credit note document, in addition to being reported in the related registered documents, are also inherited in the two fields present in the customer accounting movements.

Since our FTE APP allows you to add information relating to CIG and CUP, through the Related Document Data, even to documents already registered, in addition to the checks regarding uniqueness where possible, the updating of the data present in the customer accounting movement has been provided. The user is informed that the change will not have an effect on data already transmitted to external systems (SDI, treasury, banks).

In the Outbound Setup (FTE) a flag "Enable CIG CUP legacy mode" has been introduced that allows you to bypass the controls introduced above and restore the management of CIG and CUP to the versions prior to the change
