**Conditions** are also used for:

1.  **Rule relations** to check conditions and manage filters
2.  **BOMs** to enable or disable BOM components
3.  **Routings** to enable or disable routing lines
4.  **Business logic**
5.  **Formulas**

Conditions can be in **AND** / **OR**: the choice determines how to combine the filters together within the single condition.


In the condition lines we have to enter the conditions to combine, by specifying whether the check should be performed that **the condition is the same or** that it is **different**.

In the filter text, I can insert condition value filters according to Business Central rules.ÿIt is also possible to insert characteristics with [] when a comparison is made on the value of a feature.
