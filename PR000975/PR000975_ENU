Using the lookup list values you can define a series of parameters to be requested to the user in the activity actions:

Lookup list values can have 3 different source types: **Fixed**, **Table**, **Custom**. The **Fixed** type allows to create a parameter that assumes a fixed number of values. In the example, a lookup list with Fixed Source Type is defined that can assume the values EXT, SMA and STD.

The **Table** type allows to create a parameter that takes the values allowed by a Business Central table. In the example, a lookup list with Table Source Type is defined that can take  the values of the customer table, on which it is possible to set a filter. The dynamic values field is used for tables that must be pre-filtered, for example the bins to be pre-filtered with the location.

Lookup lists can be used within Activity Actions to insert fields to be edited and then managed through custom code by hooking up to specific events. In the example you can see the two lookup lists associated with the purchase receipt activity:

The power app displays the newly inserted activity action among the actions. Allowing the insertion of values for the expected parameters.

Lookup lists can also be used in editable fields related to user activities. Through lookup relations it is possible to manage all cases in which there are relations between the two required fields, for example Location and Bin.

The power app allows to enter values for the expected parameters.

**Custom** fields can also be set to editable, in these cases to manage the change you need to use the following event of the codeunit **18060051 "EOS089 WMS Add. Fields Mgmt."**:

**OnValidateCustomField(EmployeeNo, EOS089WMSUserActField, RecordRef, NewValue, IsHandled)**

There are two events to check, in the case of mandatory fields, that they actually need to be checked, in the codeunit **18060025 "EOS089 WMS User Activity Mgmt."**:

**OnCheckMandatoryFieldByFieldValue(RecordRef: RecordRef; FieldRef: FieldRef; EOS089WMSUserActField: Record "EOS089 WMS User Act. Field"; FieldValue: Variant; var IsHandled: Boolean)**

**OnCheckMandatoryFieldByCustomValue(RecordRef: RecordRef; EOS089WMSUserActField: Record "EOS089 WMS User Act. Field"; FieldValue: Variant; var IsHandled: Boolean)**
