The app allows invoicing based on registered sales transactions.
Invoicing can take place immediately after the sales transaction is registered, or later at the head office.

The app allows issuing two types of sales documents:
* Immediate sales invoice/credit memo
* Deferred sales invoice/credit memo

The invoicing method can be defined within each customer’s master data through the “POS Invoice Type” field, which can have three values:
* Request → the system asks the cashier whether the sales document should be immediate or deferred
* Direct Invoice → the system creates and posts the sales document at the end of the sales transaction registration
* Cumulative Invoice → the system creates and posts a sales shipment based on the registered sales transaction. The creation and posting of the shipment occurs when the store statement is registered.

If the “POS Ask for Invoice Post” field is enabled in the "Sales & Receivables Setup", when performing the “Total” action at the POS, the system will first display a confirmation request:

Depending on the value of the “POS Invoice Type” field, the system will display a different message at the POS after executing the “Total” action.
If the value is Request, the user must choose the invoicing type to apply for that specific sales transaction:
