To calculate bonus entries, we open the Customer/Vendor Bonus List list, select one or more lines, and choose Related -> Bonus -> Calculate Ledger Entries.

The calculation can be performed massively or per contract.

Given the average volume of the data, it is recommended to schedule the report.

Business Central will calculate the tax base of the bonus calculation for all certified contracts.

This allows you to view the calculation basis of each contract line and any expected amount, if the forecast is handled.
