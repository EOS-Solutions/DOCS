## **Commissions Calculation Setup (CMS)**

In the Commissions Calculation Setup (CMS) you can set up commissions with the following criteria:

• Sales network

• Salesperson role

• Salesperson

• Customer Commission Group

• Customer

• Line type

• Product

• Product Commission Group

• Date

If the line of the sales document is applicable to multiple criteria, the system selects the criterion based on the priorities defined in the Commissions Setup (CMS). The commissions can be calculated for:

• Percentage: to be calculated on the base amount (taxable VAT, with or without discounts according to the Commissions Setup (CMS)) for each sales line falling within the setup parameters.

• Fixed Amount: commission amount that is assigned to the salesperson for each sales line that falls within the parameter setup. The fixed amount may be defined on the same line of the percentage, the two fields are not mutually exclusive.

• Threshold: threshold are defined for the calculation of commission. The threshold are calculated thanks to the Set Threshold button.

At the top we can find all the possible filters::

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000493-0/CommCalcSetup8.png"><br>

Through the Set Threshold button it is possible to define the % commission and / or the amount of the threshold associated with the line discount.
