Invoice discount and line discount take a default value in the header of the Price Group but can be edited for each line. 

Upon certification, the price list undergoes a reliability and correctness check. To be used, the price list must be in the "Certified" state. 

The price list can be modified by editing the status to "in development." The list in this state retains validity. It will be overwritten when the status returns to "Certified." 

To retire the price list, the status must be set to "Closed." It is also possible to define a validity date for the price list by populating the "start date" and "end date" fields.
