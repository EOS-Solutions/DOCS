To activate, set up, and use the app, you need the proper permission set. The easier way is to set the user as ”SUPER”. If you don’t want to set the ”SUPER” permission set, apply all Permission set starting with ”EOS\*”

## No active plan or subscription ?

Maybe your server is not connecting to the EOS Online service. <br>
Execute the action "**Test API Connection**" in the Subscription control panel.

<br>

If not, try checking the following:

**If your Business Central environment is OnPremise:**

 1. Check your internet connection

 2. Verify that HTTP requests are allowed for the EOS Admin Library app

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000728-0/3GettingStartedEosApps.jpg">

<br>
<br>
<br>

 3. In case of Docker environment, check the connection and DNS

 4. Verify the BC service user reaches <https://publicapi.eos-solutions.it/> : the expected response via browser is 403, in case of error 404 it means that the server cannot reach this address. Check firewall and connection

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000728-0/4GettingStartedEosApps.jpg">

<br>
<br>
<br>

You can check the connectivity with this PowerShell command taking care of:

 1. RUN IT FROM THE SERVER ON WHICH THE BUSINESS CENTRAL SERVICE IS RUNNING

 2. RUN IT USING THE USER USED BY THE BUSINESS CENTRAL SERVICE

Invoke-RestMethod <https://publicapi.eos-solutions.it/status>

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000728-0/5GettingStartedEosApps.jpg">

<br>
<br>

**If your Business Central environment is OnLine (Saas):**

 1. Verify that http requests are allowed for the EOS Admin Library app

 2. Consider that for PROD environments this setting is by default=true, while on sandbox environments is by default=false

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000728-0/3GettingStartedEosApps.jpg">


<br>

After carrying out the checks, the steps to be performed are:

1.  Open Business Central
2.  Type ALT+Q and search for “Subscription Control Panel”
3.  Run the page and click “**Refresh from Server**"
4.  Log off and on again to Business Central
