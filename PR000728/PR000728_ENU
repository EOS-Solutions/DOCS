## No active plan or subscription ?

Maybe your server is not connecting to EOS Online service, try checking the following

**If your Business Central environment is OnPremise:**

\- Check your internet connection

\- Verify that http requests are allowed for the EOS Admin Library app

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000728-0/3GettingStartedEosApps.jpg">

<br>
<br>
<br>

\- In case of Docker environment check connection and DNS

\- Verify the BC service user reaches <https://publicapi.eos-solutions.it/> : the expected response via browser is 403, in case of error 404 it means that the server cannot reach this address. Check firewall and connection

<br>
<br>
<br>

You can check the connectivity with this PowerShell command taking care of:

\- RUN IT FROM THE SERVER ON WHICH THE BUSINESS CENTRAL SERVICE IS RUNNING

\- RUN IT USING THE USER USED BY THE BUSINESS CENTRAL SERVICE

Invoke-RestMethod <https://publicapi.eos-solutions.it/status>

<br>
<br>

**If your Business Central environment is OnLine (Saas):**

\- Verify that http requests are allowed for the EOS Admin Library app

\- Consider that for PROD environments this setting is by default=true, while on sandbox environments is by default=false

After carrying out the checks, the steps to be performed are:

1.  Open Business Central
2.  Type ALT+Q and search for “Subscription Control Panel”
3.  Run the page and click “**Refresh from Server**"
4.  Log off and on again to Business Central
