We renegotiate an accounting entry, having previously set the setup to "Correct existing entries". 
For the invoice 21-102039 the system shows two installments:

Through Add Occurrency we insert a new installment of 1200,00 euros (reducing the amount of one of the other two)

and we post.

In this case, a closing record is not generated, but one of the two installments is modified and a third one is added. On the added installment, the system reports the new Due date (08/30) and the Old Due Date (06/30)).

With this setup, the renegotiated transactions are not marked with the "Renegotiation No." fields and "Renegotiated by". The same accounting movement could in fact be renegotiated several times.
