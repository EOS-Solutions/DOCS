In order to use the "Suggest Line For Packing" function, you must fill in a setup in "Packaging Instructions". This setup provides the system with the information to create the packaging for each different item:

For example, entering a sales line for item 1000 with quantity 20 with the following packaging instructions:

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000560-0/EX055-PL-02-ENU.png"><br>

* Packaging material BOX01.
* Load carrier PALLET01.
* Quantity 4. This means that in each BOX01 there are 4 units of item 1000.
* Nr. of layers 2. Load carrier PALLET01 has two layers.
* Quantity for layer 2. That means that for each layer there are 2 BOX01. for a total of 4 BOX01. 

I get the following packing list calculation:

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000560-0/EX055-PL-03-ENU.png"><br>

* 2 PALLET01.
* 5 BOX01.
* 20 units of item 1000.
* The first PALLET01 is complete and therefore contains 4 BOX01 and 16 units of item 1000.
* The second PALLET01 instead contains the remaining, that is 1 BOX01 with 4 units of item 1000.
