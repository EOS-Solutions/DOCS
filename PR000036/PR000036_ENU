Eos Solutions Packing List (PCK) app, allows the creation of a packing list connected to:

* Sales Orders
* Warehouse Shipments
* Purchase Orders
* Transfer Orders
* Return Shipments
* Warehouse Receipts

The app can be used alone or in combination with the **EX030 Handling Units Management** app.
If used alone, it does not allow all the handling units movements (for example put-away, pick, reclassification, Item Journals, etc.).
