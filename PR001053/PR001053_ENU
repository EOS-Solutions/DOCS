Following Microsoft's deprecation of Bing services, Map Services and Delivery Route Planner apps have been rolled out with support for the new Azure Maps services.
For information on services and prices, the following link is available: [https://azure.microsoft.com/it-it/products/azure-maps](http://) 
 
The services used, at the moment, are the following (N.B. indicative prices consult the website for valid prices):

To use Azure Maps, after creating your subscription, you then need to create a Service Configuration (EAL): 
Setting the following Endpoint Uri = **https://atlas.microsoft.com**
Also, set the **Client ID** and **Primary Key** fields that you just created with your subscription to the service.

The newly created Service Configuration (EAL) must then be set up in the **Map Services Setup (MAPS)**:

The connection test can be done, for example, by moving to a customer's personal data and using the **Geolocations** function:

and from the **Geolocations (MAPS)** page :

In the **Delivery Route Setup**, two new fields have been added that activate the following features, active only for Azure Maps:

* **Default route map.** Which takes on the following values: **Google Maps**, **Bing Maps**. Azure Maps does not provide, at least at this time, a route view. Therefore, you can optionally use Google Maps or Bing Maps to display your route on a map.
* **Default travel mode.** Which assumes the following values: **Truck**, **Car**. It is used as a parameter in route calculation. The route optimization is instead always calculated with the Truck vehicle (default not modifiable of Azure Maps).
