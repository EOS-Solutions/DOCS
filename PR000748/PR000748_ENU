Mandatory tables allow to insert checks on records before making a status transaction through filters. This functionality is accessible from the Mandatory Tables action on the page:
* EDS Tables Setup -> Status Transactions -> Mandatory Tables

These controls can be implemented through conditions which can be of 3 types:
<br>
<br>

|Filters|Behavior|
|---|---|
|Empty                     |Table must be empty, it's possible to set filters|
|Not Empty                 |Table must not be empty, it's possible to set filters|
|Father Field Filter       |Performs a comparison between a field in the selected table and a field in the father table by setting a formula

<br>
The checks are carried out individually one by one, the filters are not combined.
<br>

<br>
For each row of the mandatory tables, preconditions can be added which will be verified before the check, if the result is negative then the check will not be carried out.
