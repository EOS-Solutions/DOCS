| Can invoices be sent in bulk or only one at a time?                                                                                                                                                                                             | Invoices can be sent: one at a time from the Registered Invoice List, by selecting the invoice to send and pressing Ribbon-\>Send-\>Electronic Document. Directly from the Registered Sales Invoice List, select the invoices to send, and use Ribbon-\>Send-\>Electronic Document. This way, the selected invoices will be sent together based on the configured setup. Through a bulk report, you can periodically send, in bulk, the invoices that have not been sent yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| How does electronic invoicing integrate with a system where the EDI module is already active, which allows sending Invoices and Credit Notes to Customers?                                                                                      | The EDI system will continue to operate in parallel with the Active and Passive Cycles of Electronic Invoicing but without any legal value. The information transmitted by the EDI system must also be reconciled with what passes through the SdI. Only the latter is fiscally valid. The EDI functionalities and those of electronic invoicing are not integrated. An invoice received via EDI can be manually linked to the XML file when it is received from the SdI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Do payment method codes need to be standardized with those provided by the Tax Agency?                                                                                                                                                          | Yes, in the Payment Methods table setup, the Payment Method Code for electronic documents should be filled in with the codes provided by the Tax Agency. N. B. When receiving electronic invoices (Passive Cycle): if the company uses only one payment method, it will be automatically reconciled by the system. If the company has multiple Business Central payment codes corresponding to the codes of the Tax Agency, the user will need to manually link these payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| If I have sent an incorrect invoice (e.g., quantity or amount), can I reissue it?                                                                                                                                                               | If the invoice has already been received by the recipient, a Credit Note must be issued. If the recipient has not received the invoice because it has been blocked by the SdI (e.g., it did not pass the checks), it can be resent. Business Central allows you to regenerate the file (with a different ID) and resend it (an ID can only pass through the SdI once). N. B. Two files with different IDs can contain the same Invoice Number reference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| In the case of advance payments, should advance invoices also be transmitted?                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes, they should be transmitted as invoices in all respects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| How should self-invoices issued for gifts be handled?                                                                                                                                                                                           | In Business Central, you can issue a self-invoice by selecting "Self-invoicing Customer" as the Customer Name, which is the same company that issues the invoice. The generated file must have Document Type Code=TD20. This code will be recognized by the SdI as a Self-invoice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| How does the management of non-delivery notifications for issued invoices work?                                                                                                                                                                 | From within Business Central, you can check the status of document submission to the SdI. The options are: -missed delivery -receipt of delivery -rejection** **In the case of missed delivery, for example, you can send the invoice to the customer via email, informing them that the invoice is available in their tax drawer on the Tax Agency's website. In the case of rejection, the invoice is fiscally considered not issued. It can be resent if there is only a formal error that can be corrected and does not affect fiscal data such as amounts and VAT, or it can be reversed and reissued.

A default setup can also be created that applies to all suppliers not associated with other setups. In each setup, control rules and reconciliation weights will be defined. You cannot choose which fields to map because ALL fields in the invoice are mapped to Nav fields.

| How should an incorrect invoice (e.g., quantity, amount, etc.) be handled?                                                        | Only public administrations (PAs) can reject invoices. A private entity cannot reject invoices. You will need to contact the supplier, and an agreement will be reached for issuing a possible Credit Note.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Is it possible to reject an invoice if it does not contain correct data, or can only the SdI (Interchange System) do this?        | If the data is incorrect, the IX-FE system pre-emptively rejects the invoice and notifies the issuer. This happens within seconds. Otherwise, the Interchange System will notify that the document is incorrect. Rejection by the recipient is an exclusive option of the public system. A private entity cannot reject an electronic invoice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| What is meant by a rejected invoice? How is rejection integrated into the management system?                                      | If the PA is the company using NAV + Platform, it has a "Reject" button available to reject the invoice. For all private companies, the status of invoices coming from IX-FE will be marked as "Rejected." At this point, you will need to modify and reissue the same invoice or create a Credit Note and issue a new invoice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| How long does IX-FE take to transmit invoices to the Interchange System?                                                          | Delivery of the invoice from IX-FE to the SdI (Interchange System) happens in real-time because IX-FE operates through the SdI-COOP protocol, allowing IX-FE to "write" directly to the SdI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| For which versions of Nav are functionalities related to the Active Cycle, Passive Cycle, and Integration with IX-FE available?   | It is planned as a phased release, with each package focusing on a specific functionality. The solution can be installed on all versions of Nav (with some limitations for the 2009 versions, which are not aligned with current operating systems/web service protocols):  NAV 2009 - Classic Client NAV 2009 R2 - RTC Client NAV 2013 NAV 2013 R2 NAV 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| How should an organization prepare to comply with the regulations?                                                                | It is very important to act in advance and Choose your intermediary carefully (e.g., Abletech) Provide the necessary information on the Revenue Agency's website (and link the intermediary to your VAT number) Update the operating system and master data Test the solution (e.g., by verifying the generated XML files) Define roles within the company                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| If we already have an electronic storage system, at what point should we integrate it with IX-FE?                                 | It is possible to integrate an existing electronic storage system within a company with IX. There is a specific configuration to be done both on the IX side and the Nav side, which will allow access to IX to download and store invoices in compliance with the law.  In Nav, from the List of Document Storage Movements, it is possible to mass extract documents that have already been processed. In this way, active documents are regenerated, and passive documents are created from the imported p7m files at the beginning of the passive cycle process. This allows the documents to be saved in customer/supplier folders for compliant archiving. |
| Will Abletech provide us with the recipient code?                                                                                 | Yes, after signing the contract, Abletech will provide the recipient code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Does IX-FE check for formal errors in the XML? Does it anticipate the activities of the SdI (Interchange System)?                 | Yes, the intermediary performs an initial formal check on the XML file, ensuring that it complies with the requirements of the regulations. For example, it adds the data of the intermediary itself that transmits the file, normalizes nomenclature, and can assign the recipient code or PEC (Certified Email). IX also applies a digital signature (not mandatory).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Currently, we collect payment upon delivery by presenting the (accompanying) invoice.

| What happens if the accompanying (paper) invoice given to the customer is rejected (does not pass the checks)?                    | The paper copy has no value. It is only for payment purposes. If the total on the invoice differs from what was paid, there will be an incorrect charge or credit, necessitating positive or negative adjustment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| What will happen when the European regulation comes into effect?                                                                  | The European regulation is not yet uniform in terms of electronic invoicing obligations. Germany, for example, has no obligations in place, some countries have partial obligations towards public administrations, while others have total obligations. Italy is the only country that has extended the obligation to B2B transactions, and it had to request an extension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
