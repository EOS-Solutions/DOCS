EOS FunctionAPI leverages the .NET core logging architecture for logging messages and diagnostics. This allows EOS FunctionAPI to log to different log storages including files, event log or Application Insights.

Logging is configured by modifying the `appsettings.json` file of your service instance. This file is found in the folder of EOS FunctionAPI and can be modified with your text editor of choice.

As of today, EOS FunctionAPI supports logging to the following storages:
- Console
- Application Insights
- Event Log
- Local file

Thos logging infrastructure allows you to select which messages are logged and which are not. You can filter them by log source, or severity, or even configure the severity to be logged based on the log source. You can find more information on the documentation of [Logging in .NET Core and ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/?view=aspnetcore-6.0)
