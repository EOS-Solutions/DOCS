EOS FunctionAPI leverages the .NET core logging architecture for logging messages and diagnostics. This allows EOS FunctionAPI to log to different log storages including files, event log or Application Insights.

Logging is configured by modifying the `appsettings.json` file of your service instance. This file is found in the folder of EOS FunctionAPI and can be modified with your text editor of choice.

As of today, EOS FunctionAPI supports logging to the following storages:
- Console
- Application Insights
- Event Log
- Local file
