**Unit of Measure**

From the Unit of Measure, a cross reference can be defined so that the system recognizes the units of measure present in the .xml file.

**Checks**

You can see the checks that the system makes on the documents and the error codes. The list can be modified only in the Description and Check type column.

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000305-0/22ElectronicInvoiceForItaly.png"><br>

It is possible to choose whether for each check the system shows:

ERROR: in this case the user is blocked in the execution of the following steps

WARNING: it does not block the user, but warns that there is some anomaly in the document

NONE: the system does not perform the validation and no message / warning appears

SILENT: the system performs validation, but does not issue messages / warnings.

For the red line a further setup must be specified: Lines reconciliation ratings.

**Lines reconciliation ratings**

In Lines reconciliation ratings are set rules for automatic reconciliation of posted documents. This is done by assigning a score that indicates to the system whether the posted document has the necessary requirements to be matched:

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000305-0/23ElectronicInvoiceForItaly.png"><br>

Example:

For a specic electronic document line, If the system finds a DDT that has the **correct Vendor DDT No.**  **(25 points)** and the **exact item quantity (5 points)**, will assign to that line a total points: **25 + 5 = 30**.

Based on the setup, the system will or will not match the document. In our example, if the setup is the following:

<img width="" src="https://docs-test.eos-solutions.it/Images/PR000305-0/24ElectronicInvoiceForItaly.png"><br>

the document will be linked to the line because it has exceeded 20, but a warning will appear because the rating does not exceed 30.

**Other Setups**

For each vendor setup group it is possible to map the Cash Types with the desired destination account.
